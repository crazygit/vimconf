preg_match -- Perform a regular expression match

  int preg_match(string pattern, string subject [, array matches [, int flags [, int offset]]])~

Searches {subject} for a match to the regular expression given in {pattern}.

If {matches} is provided, then it is filled with the results of search.
$matches[0] will contain the text that matched the full pattern, $matches[1]
will have the text that matched the first captured parenthesized subpattern,
and so on.

{flags} can be the following flag: PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE If this flag is passed,
for every occurring match the appendant string offset will also be returned.
Note that this changes the return value in an array where every element is an
array consisting of the matched string at offset 0 and its string offset into
{subject} at offset 1. This flag is available since PHP 4.3.0 .

The {flags} parameter is available since PHP 4.3.0.

Normally, the search starts from the beginning of the subject string. The
optional parameter {offset} can be used to specify the alternate place from
which to start the search. The {offset} parameter is available since PHP
4.3.3.
