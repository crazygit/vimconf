odbc_execute -- Execute a prepared statement

  bool odbc_execute(resource result_id [, array parameters_array])~

Executes a statement prepared with |odbc_prepare|.Returns TRUE on success or
FALSE on failure. The array {parameters_array} only needs to be given if you
really have parameters in your statement.

Parameters in {parameter_array} will be substituted for placeholders in the
prepared statement in order.

Any parameters in {parameter_array} which start and end with single quotes
will be taken as the name of a file to read and send to the database server
as the data for the appropriate placeholder.

As of PHP 4.1.1, this file reading functionality has the following
restrictions: File reading is not subject to any safe mode or open-basedir
restrictions. This is fixed in PHP 4.2.0.

Remote files are not supported.

If you wish to store a string which actually begins and ends with single
quotes, you must escape them or add a space or other non-single-quote
character to the beginning or end of the parameter, which will prevent the
parameter's being taken as a file name. If this is not an option, then you
must use another mechanism to store the string, such as executing the query
directly with |odbc_exec|).
