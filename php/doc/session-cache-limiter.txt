session_cache_limiter -- Get and/or set the current cache limiter

  string session_cache_limiter([string cache_limiter])~

|session_cache_limiter| returns the name of the current cache limiter. If
{cache_limiter} is specified, the name of the current cache limiter is
changed to the new value.

The cache limiter defines which cache control HTTP headers are sent to the
client. These headers determine the rules by which the page content may be
cached by the client and intermediate proxies. Setting the cache limiter to
nocache disallows any client/proxy caching. A value of public permits caching
by proxies and the client, whereas private disallows caching by proxies and
permits the client to cache the contents.

In private mode, the Expire header sent to the client may cause confusion for
some browsers, including Mozilla. You can avoid this problem by using
private_no_expire mode. The expire header is never sent to the client in this
mode.

private_no_expire was added in PHP 4.2.0.

The cache limiter is reset to the default value stored in
session.cache_limiter at request startup time. Thus, you need to call
|session_cache_limiter| for every request (and before |session_start| is
called).

|session_cache_limiter| example

<?php >
  /* set the cache limiter to 'private' */
  
  session_cache_limiter('private');
  $cache_limiter = session_cache_limiter();
  
  echo "The cache limiter is now set to $cache_limiter<br />";
?>

Also see the session.cache_limiter configuration directive.
