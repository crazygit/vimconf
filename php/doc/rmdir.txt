rmdir -- Removes directory

  bool rmdir(string dirname [, resource context])~

Attempts to remove the directory named by {dirname}. The directory must be
empty, and the relevant permissions must permit this. Returns TRUE on success
or FALSE on failure.

As of PHP 5.0.0 |rmdir| can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer to for
a listing of which wrappers support |rmdir|.

Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of contexts, refer
to .

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the directory in which you are
about to operate has the same UID (owner) as the script that is being
executed.

See also |mkdir| and |unlink|.
