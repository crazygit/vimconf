SWFMorph -- Creates a new SWFMorph object

  SWFMorph swfmorph()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfmorph| creates a new SWFMorph object.

Also called a "shape tween". This thing lets you make those tacky twisting
things that make your computer choke. Oh, joy!

The methods here are sort of weird. It would make more sense to just have
newSWFMorph(shape1, shape2);, but as things are now, shape2 needs to know
that it's the second part of a morph. (This, because it starts writing its
output as soon as it gets drawing commands- if it kept its own description of
its shapes and wrote on completion this and some other things would be much
easier.)

SWFMorph has the following methods : |swfmorph->getshape1| and
|swfmorph->getshape1|.

This simple example will morph a big red square into a smaller blue
black-bordered square. |swfmorph| example

<?php >
    $p = new SWFMorph();
  
    $s = $p->getShape1();
    $s->setLine(0, 0, 0, 0);
  
    /* Note that this is backwards from normal shapes (left instead of right).
       I have no idea why, but this seems to work.. */
  
    $s->setLeftFill($s->addFill(0xff, 0, 0));
    $s->movePenTo(-1000,-1000);
    $s->drawLine(2000,0);
    $s->drawLine(0,2000);
    $s->drawLine(-2000,0);
    $s->drawLine(0,-2000);
  
    $s = $p->getShape2();
    $s->setLine(60,0,0,0);
    $s->setLeftFill($s->addFill(0, 0, 0xff));
    $s->movePenTo(0,-1000);
    $s->drawLine(1000,1000);
    $s->drawLine(-1000,1000);
    $s->drawLine(-1000,-1000);
    $s->drawLine(1000,-1000);
  
    $m = new SWFMovie();
    $m->setDimension(3000,2000);
    $m->setBackground(0xff, 0xff, 0xff);
  
    $i = $m->add($p);
    $i->moveTo(1500,1000);
  
    for ($r=0.0; $r<=1.0; $r+=0.1) {
      $i->setRatio($r);
      $m->nextFrame();
    }
  
    header('Content-type: application/x-shockwave-flash');
    $m->output();
?>
