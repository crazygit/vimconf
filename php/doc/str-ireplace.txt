str_ireplace -- Case-insensitive version of str_replace.

  mixed str_ireplace(mixed search, mixed replace, mixed subject [, int count])~

This function returns a string or an array with all occurrences of {search} in
{subject} (ignoring case) replaced with the given {replace} value. If you
don't need fancy replacing rules, you should generally use this function
instead of |eregi_replace| or |preg_replace| with the i modifier.

If {subject} is an array, then the search and replace is performed with every
entry of {subject}, and the return value is an array as well.

If {search} and {replace} are arrays, then |str_ireplace| takes a value from
each array and uses them to do search and replace on {subject}. If {replace}
has fewer values than {search}, then an empty string is used for the rest of
replacement values. If {search} is an array and {replace} is a string; then
this replacement string is used for every value of {search}.

|str_ireplace| example

<?php >
  $bodytag = str_ireplace("%body%", "black", "<body text=%BODY%>");
?>

This function is binary safe.

As of PHP 5.0.0 the number of matched and replaced {needles} will be returned
in {count} which is passed by reference. Prior to PHP 5.0.0 this parameter is
not available.
