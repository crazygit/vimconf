PDOStatement::fetchAll -- Returns an array containing all of the result set
rows

  array PDOStatement::fetchAll([int fetch_style])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

{fetch_style} Controls the contents of the returned array as documented in
|PDOStatement::fetch|. Defaults to PDO_FETCH_BOTH.

|PDOStatement::fetchAll| returns an array containing all of the remaining rows
in the result set. The array represents each row as either an array of column
values or an object with properties corresponding to each column name.

Using this method to fetch large result sets will result in a heavy demand on
system and possibly network resources. Rather than retrieving all of the data
and manipulating it in PHP, consider using the database server to manipulate
the result sets. For example, use the WHERE and SORT BY clauses in SQL to
restrict results before retrieving and processing them with PHP.

Fetch all remaining rows in a result set

<?php >
  $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT name, colour FROM fruit");
  $sth->execute();
  
  /* Fetch all of the remaining rows in the result set */
  print("Fetch all of the remaining rows in the result set:\n");
  $result = $sth->fetchAll();
  print_r($result);
?>

The above example will output:

  Fetch all of the remaining rows in the result set:
  Array
  (
      [0] => Array
          (
              [NAME] => pear
              [0] => pear
              [COLOUR] => green
              [1] => green
          )
  
      [1] => Array
          (
              [NAME] => watermelon
              [0] => watermelon
              [COLOUR] => pink
              [1] => pink
          )
  
  )
