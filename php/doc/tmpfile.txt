tmpfile -- Creates a temporary file

  resource tmpfile()~

Creates a temporary file with an unique name in read-write (w+) mode,
returning a file handle similar to the one returned by |fopen|. The file is
automatically removed when closed (using |fclose|), or when the script ends.

For details, consult your system documentation on the tmpfile(3) function, as
well as the stdio.h header file.

|tmpfile| example

<?php >
  $temp = tmpfile();
  fwrite($temp, "writing to tempfile");
  fseek($temp, 0);
  echo fread($temp, 1024);
  fclose($temp); // this removes the file
?>

The above example will output:

  writing to tempfile
