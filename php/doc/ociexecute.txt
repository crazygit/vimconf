ociexecute -- Execute a statement

  bool ociexecute(resource stmt [, int mode])~

|ociexecute| executes a previously parsed statement. (see |ociparse|). The
optional {mode} allows you to specify the execution-mode (default is
OCI_COMMIT_ON_SUCCESS). If you don't want statements to be committed
automatically specify OCI_DEFAULT as your mode.

This function was renamed to |oci_execute| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For downward
compatibility |ociexecute| can also be used. This is deprecated, however.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
