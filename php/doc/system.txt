system -- Execute an external program and display the output

  string system(string command [, int return_var])~

|system| is just like the C version of the function in that it executes the
given {command} and outputs the result.

The |system| call also tries to automatically flush the web server's output
buffer after each line of output if PHP is running as a server module.

If you need to execute a command and have all the data from the command passed
directly back without any interference, use the |passthru| function.

{command} The command that will be executed.

{return_var} If the {return_var} argument is present, then the return status
of the executed command will be written to this variable.

Returns the last line of the command output on success, and FALSE on failure.

|system| example

<?php >
  echo '<pre>';
  
  // Outputs all the result of shellcommand "ls", and returns
  // the last output line into $last_line. Stores the return value
  // of the shell command in $retval.
  $last_line = system('ls', $retval);
  
  // Printing additional info
  echo '
  </pre>
  <hr />Last line of the output: ' . $last_line . '
  <hr />Return value: ' . $retval;
?>

If you are going to allow data coming from user input to be passed to this
function, then you should be using |escapeshellarg| or |escapeshellcmd| to
make sure that users cannot trick the system into executing arbitrary
commands.

If you start a program using this function and want to leave it running in the
background, you have to make sure that the output of that program is
redirected to a file or some other output stream or else PHP will hang until
the execution of the program ends.

When safe mode is enabled, you can only execute executables within the
safe_mode_exec_dir. For practical reasons it is currently not allowed to have
.. components in the path to the executable.

With safe mode enabled, all words following the initial command string are
treated as a single argument. Thus, echo y | echo x becomes echo "y | echo
x".
