implode -- Join array elements with a string

  string implode(string glue, array pieces)~

Returns a string containing a string representation of all the array elements
in the same order, with the glue string between each element. |implode|
example

<?php >
  $array = array('lastname', 'email', 'phone');
  $comma_separated = implode(",", $array);
  
  echo $comma_separated; // lastname,email,phone
?>

|implode| can, for historical reasons, accept its parameters in either order.
For consistency with |explode|, however, it may be less confusing to use the
documented order of arguments.

As of PHP 4.3.0, the glue parameter of |implode| is optional and defaults to
the empty string(''). This is not the preferred usage of |implode|. We
recommend to always use two parameters for compatibility with older versions.

This function is binary-safe.

See also |explode|, and |split|.
