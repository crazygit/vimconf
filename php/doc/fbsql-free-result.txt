fbsql_free_result -- Free result memory

  bool fbsql_free_result(resource result)~

|fbsql_free_result| will free all memory associated with the result identifier
{result}.

|fbsql_free_result| only needs to be called if you are concerned about how
much memory is being used for queries that return large result sets. All
associated result memory is automatically freed at the end of the script's
execution.
