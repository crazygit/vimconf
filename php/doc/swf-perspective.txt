swf_perspective -- Define a perspective projection transformation

  void swf_perspective(float fovy, float aspect, float near, float far)~

The |swf_perspective| function defines a perspective projection
transformation. The {fovy} parameter is field-of-view angle in the y
direction. The {aspect} parameter should be set to the aspect ratio of the
viewport that is being drawn onto. The {near} parameter is the near clipping
plane and the {far} parameter is the far clipping plane.

Various distortion artifacts may appear when performing a perspective
projection, this is because Flash players only have a two dimensional matrix.
Some are not to pretty.
