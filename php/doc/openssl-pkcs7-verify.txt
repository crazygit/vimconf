openssl_pkcs7_verify -- Verifies the signature of an S/MIME signed message

  mixed openssl_pkcs7_verify(string filename, int flags [, string outfilename [, array cainfo [, string extracerts]]])~

|openssl_pkcs7_verify| reads the S/MIME message contained in the filename
specified by {filename} and examines the digital signature. It returns TRUE
if the signature is verified, FALSE if it is not correct (the message has
been tampered with, or the signing certificate is invalid), or -1 on error.

{flags} can be used to affect how the signature is verified - see PKCS7
constants for more information.

If the {outfilename} is specified, it should be a string holding the name of a
file into which the certificates of the persons that signed the messages will
be stored in PEM format.

If the {cainfo} is specified, it should hold information about the trusted CA
certificates to use in the verification process - see certificate
verification for more information about this parameter.

If the {extracerts} is specified, it is the filename of a file containing a
bunch of certificates to use as untrusted CAs.
