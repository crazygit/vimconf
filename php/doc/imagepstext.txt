imagepstext -- To draw a text string over an image using PostScript Type1
fonts

  array imagepstext(resource image, string text, resource font, int size, int foreground, int background, int x, int y [, int space, int tightness, float angle, int antialias_steps])~

{foreground} is the color in which the text will be painted. {Background} is
the color to which the text will try to fade in with antialiasing. No pixels
with the color {background} are actually painted, so the background image
does not need to be of solid color.

The coordinates given by {x}, {y} will define the origin (or reference point)
of the first character (roughly the lower-left corner of the character). This
is different from the |imagestring|, where {x}, {y} define the upper-right
corner of the first character. Refer to PostScript documentation about fonts
and their measuring system if you have trouble understanding how this works.

{space} allows you to change the default value of a space in a font. This
amount is added to the normal value and can also be negative.

{tightness} allows you to control the amount of white space between
characters. This amount is added to the normal character width and can also
be negative.

{angle} is in degrees.

{size} is expressed in pixels.

{antialias_steps} allows you to control the number of colours used for
antialiasing text. Allowed values are 4 and 16. The higher value is
recommended for text sizes lower than 20, where the effect in text quality is
quite visible. With bigger sizes, use 4. It's less computationally intensive.

Parameters {space} and {tightness} are expressed in character space units,
where 1 unit is 1/1000th of an em-square.

Parameters {space}, {tightness}, {angle} and {antialias_steps} are optional.

This function is only available if PHP is compiled using --with-t1lib[=DIR].

This function returns an array containing the following elements: 0 lower left
x-coordinate 1 lower left y-coordinate 2 upper right x-coordinate 3 upper
right y-coordinate
