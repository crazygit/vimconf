ibase_connect -- Open a connection to an InterBase database

  resource ibase_connect([string database [, string username [, string password [, string charset [, int buffers [, int dialect [, string role [, int sync]]]]]]]])~

Establishes a connection to an InterBase server. The {database} argument has
to be a valid path to database file on the server it resides on. If the
server is not local, it must be prefixed with either 'hostname:' (TCP/IP),
'//hostname/' (NetBEUI) or 'hostname@' (IPX/SPX), depending on the connection
protocol used. {username} and {password} can also be specified with PHP
configuration directives ibase.default_user and ibase.default_password.
{charset} is the default character set for a database. {buffers} is the
number of database buffers to allocate for the server-side cache. If 0 or
omitted, server chooses its own default. {dialect} selects the default SQL
dialect for any statement executed within a connection, and it defaults to
the highest one supported by client libraries.

In case a second call is made to |ibase_connect| with the same arguments, no
new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned. The link to the server will be closed as soon as
the execution of the script ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly
calling |ibase_close|. |ibase_connect| example

<?php >
      $host = 'localhost:/path/to/your.gdb';
  
      $dbh = ibase_connect($host, $username, $password);
      $stmt = 'SELECT * FROM tblname';
      $sth = ibase_query($dbh, $stmt);
      while ($row = ibase_fetch_object($sth)) {
          echo $row->email, "\n";
      }
      ibase_free_result($sth);
      ibase_close($dbh);
?>

The optional {buffers} parameter was added in PHP 4.0.0.

The optional {dialect} parameter was added in PHP 4.0.0 and is functional only
with InterBase 6 and up.

The optional {role} parameter was added in PHP 4.0.0 and is functional only
with InterBase 5 and up.

If you get some error like "arithmetic exception, numeric overflow, or string
truncation. Cannot transliterate character between character sets" (this
occurs when you try use some character with accents) when using this and
after |ibase_query| you must set the character set (i.e. ISO8859_1 or your
current character set).

See also |ibase_pconnect| and |ibase_close|.
