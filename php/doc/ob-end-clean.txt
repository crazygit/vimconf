ob_end_clean -- Clean (erase) the output buffer and turn off output buffering

  bool ob_end_clean()~

This function discards the contents of the topmost output buffer and turns off
this output buffering. If you want to further process the buffer's contents
you have to call |ob_get_contents| before |ob_end_clean| as the buffer
contents are discarded when |ob_end_flush| is called. The function returns
TRUE when it successfully discarded one buffer and FALSE otherwise. Reasons
for failure are first that you called the function without an active buffer
or that for some reason a buffer could not be deleted (possible for special
buffer).

The following example shows an easy way to get rid of all output buffers:

|ob_end_clean| example

<?php >
  while (@ob_end_clean());
?>

If the function fails it generates an E_NOTICE.

The boolean return value was added in PHP 4.2.0.
