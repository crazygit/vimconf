imagewbmp -- Output image to browser or file

  bool imagewbmp(resource image [, string filename [, int foreground]])~

|imagewbmp| creates the WBMP file in filename from the image {image}. The
{image} argument is the return from the |imagecreate| function.

The filename argument is optional, and if left off, the raw image stream will
be output directly. By sending an image/vnd.wap.wbmp content-type using
|header|, you can create a PHP script that outputs WBMP images directly. WBMP
support is only available if PHP was compiled against GD-1.8 or later.

Using the optional {foreground} parameter, you can set the foreground color.
Use an identifier obtained from |imagecolorallocate|. The default foreground
color is black.
