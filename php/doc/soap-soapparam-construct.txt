SoapParam->__construct() -- SoapParam constructor

Constructs a new SoapParam object.

{data} The data to pass or return. You can pass this parameter directly as PHP
value, but in this case it will be named as paramN and the SOAP Service may
not understand it.

{name} The parameter name.

Some examples

<?php >
  $client = new SoapClient(null,array('location' => "http://localhost/soap.php",
                                      'uri'      => "http://test-uri/"));
  $client->SomeFunction(new SoapParam($a, "a"),
                        new SoapParam($b, "b"),
                        new SoapParam($c, "c"));
?>
