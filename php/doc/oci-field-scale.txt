oci_field_scale -- Tell the scale of the field

  int oci_field_scale(resource statement, int field)~

Returns scale of the column with {field} index (1-based) or FALSE if there is
no such field.

For FLOAT columns, precision is nonzero and scale is -127. If precision is 0,
then column is NUMBER. Else it's NUMBER(precision, scale).

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocicolumnscale| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_field_scale| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

See also |oci_field_precision| and |oci_field_type|.
