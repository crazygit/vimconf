imagecopymerge -- Copy and merge part of an image

  bool imagecopymerge(resource dst_im, resource src_im, int dst_x, int dst_y, int src_x, int src_y, int src_w, int src_h, int pct)~

Copy a part of {src_im} onto {dst_im} starting at the x,y coordinates {src_x},
{src_y } with a width of {src_w} and a height of {src_h}. The portion defined
will be copied onto the x,y coordinates, {dst_x} and {dst_y}. The two images
will be merged according to {pct} which can range from 0 to 100. When {pct} =
0, no action is taken, when 100 this function behaves identically to
|imagecopy| for pallete images, while it implements alpha transparency for
true colour images.

This function was added in PHP 4.0.6
