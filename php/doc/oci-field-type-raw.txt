oci_field_type_raw -- Tell the raw Oracle data type of the field

  int oci_field_type_raw(resource statement, int field)~

|oci_field_type_raw| returns Oracle's raw data type of the field.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocicolumntyperaw| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_field_type_raw| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

However, if you want to get field's type, then |oci_field_type| will suit you
better. See |oci_field_type| for additional information.
