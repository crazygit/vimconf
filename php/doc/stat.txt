stat -- Gives information about a file

  array stat(string filename)~

Gathers the statistics of the file named by {filename}. If {filename} is a
symbolic link, statistics are from the file itself, not the symlink. |lstat|
is identical to | stat| except it would instead be based off the symlinks
status.

In case of error, |stat| returns FALSE. It also will throw a warning.

Returns an array with the statistics of the file with the following elements.
This array is zero-based. In addition to returning these attributes in a
numeric array, they can be accessed with associative indices, as noted next
to each parameter; this is available since PHP 4.0.6:

|stat| and |fstat| result format Numeric Associative (since PHP 4.0.6)
Description 0 dev device number 1 ino inode number 2 mode inode protection
mode 3 nlink number of links 4 uid userid of owner 5 gid groupid of owner 6
rdev device type, if inode device * 7 size size in bytes 8 atime time of last
access (Unix timestamp) 9 mtime time of last modification (Unix timestamp) 10
ctime time of last inode change (Unix timestamp) 11 blksize blocksize of
filesystem IO * 12 blocks number of blocks allocated * - only valid on
systems supporting the st_blksize type--other systems (i.e. Windows) return
-1.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0 this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.

See also |lstat|, |fstat|, |filemtime|, and |filegroup|.
