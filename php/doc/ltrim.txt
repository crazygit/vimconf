ltrim -- Strip whitespace (or other characters) from the beginning of a string

  string ltrim(string str [, string charlist])~

The second parameter was added in PHP 4.1.0

This function returns a string with whitespace stripped from the beginning of
{str}. Without the second parameter, |ltrim| will strip these characters: " "
(ASCII 32 (0x20)), an ordinary space.

"\t" (ASCII 9 (0x09)), a tab.

"\n" (ASCII 10 (0x0A)), a new line (line feed).

"\r" (ASCII 13 (0x0D)), a carriage return.

"\0" (ASCII 0 (0x00)), the NUL-byte.

"\x0B" (ASCII 11 (0x0B)), a vertical tab.

You can also specify the characters you want to strip, by means of the
{charlist} parameter. Simply list all characters that you want to be
stripped. With .. you can specify a range of characters.

Usage example of |ltrim|

<?php >
  $text = "\t\tThese are a few words :) ...  ";
  $trimmed = ltrim($text);
  // $trimmed = "These are a few words :) ...  "
  $trimmed = ltrim($text, " \t.");
  // $trimmed = "These are a few words :) ...  "
  $clean = ltrim($binary, "\x00..\x1F");
  // trim the ASCII control characters at the beginning of $binary 
  // (from 0 to 31 inclusive)
?>
