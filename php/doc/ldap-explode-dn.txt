ldap_explode_dn -- Splits DN into its component parts

  array ldap_explode_dn(string dn, int with_attrib)~

|ldap_explode_dn| function is used to split the DN returned by |ldap_get_dn|
and breaks it up into its component parts. Each part is known as Relative
Distinguished Name, or RDN. |ldap_explode_dn| returns an array of all those
components. {with_attrib} is used to request if the RDNs are returned with
only values or their attributes as well. To get RDNs with the attributes
(i.e. in attribute=value format) set {with_attrib} to 0 and to get only
values set it to 1.
