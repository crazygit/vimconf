imagealphablending -- Set the blending mode for an image

  bool imagealphablending(resource image, bool blendmode)~

|imagealphablending| allows for two different modes of drawing on truecolor
images. In blending mode, the alpha channel component of the color supplied
to all drawing function, such as |imagesetpixel| determines how much of the
underlying color should be allowed to shine through. As a result, gd
automatically blends the existing color at that point with the drawing color,
and stores the result in the image. The resulting pixel is opaque. In
non-blending mode, the drawing color is copied literally with its alpha
channel information, replacing the destination pixel. Blending mode is not
available when drawing on palette images. If {blendmode} is TRUE, then
blending mode is enabled, otherwise disabled. Returns TRUE on success or
FALSE on failure.

This function requires GD 2.0.1 or later.
