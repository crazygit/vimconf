pcntl_getpriority -- Get the priority of any process

  int pcntl_getpriority([int pid [, int process_identifier]])~

|pcntl_getpriority| gets the priority of {pid}. If {pid} is not specified, the
pid of the current process is used. Because priority levels can differ between
system types and kernel versions, please see your system's getpriority(2) man
page for specific details.

|pcntl_getpriority| returns the priority of the process or FALSE on error. A
lower numerical value causes more favorable scheduling.

{process_identifier} is one of PRIO_PGRP, PRIO_USER or PRIO_PROCESS.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.
