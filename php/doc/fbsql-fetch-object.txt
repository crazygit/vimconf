fbsql_fetch_object -- Fetch a result row as an object

  object fbsql_fetch_object(resource result [, int result_type])~

Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE
if there are no more rows.

|fbsql_fetch_object| is similar to |fbsql_fetch_array|, with one difference -
an object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you
can only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets
(numbers are illegal property names).

The optional argument {result_type} is a constant and can take the following
values: FBSQL_ASSOC, FBSQL_NUM, and FBSQL_BOTH.

Speed-wise, the function is identical to |fbsql_fetch_array|, and almost as
quick as |fbsql_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).
|fbsql_fetch_object| example

<?php >
  fbsql_connect($host, $user, $password);
  $result = fbsql_db_query("database", "select * from table");
  while ($row = fbsql_fetch_object($result)) {
      echo $row->user_id;
      echo $row->fullname;
  }
  fbsql_free_result($result);
?>
