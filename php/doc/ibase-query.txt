ibase_query -- Execute a query on an InterBase database

  resource ibase_query([resource link_identifier, string query [, int bind_args]])~

Performs a query on an InterBase database. If the query raises an error,
returns FALSE. If it is successful and there is a (possibly empty) result set
(such as with a SELECT query), returns a result identifier. If the query was
successful and there were no results, returns TRUE.

|ibase_query| example

<?php >
      $host = 'localhost:/path/to/your.gdb';
  
      $dbh = ibase_connect($host, $username, $password);
      $stmt = 'SELECT * FROM tblname';
  
      $sth = ibase_query($dbh, $stmt) or die(ibase_errmsg());
?>

In PHP 5.0.0 and up, this function will return the number of rows affected by
the query for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements. In order to retain
backward compatibility, it will return TRUE for these statements if the query
succeeded without affecting any rows.

If you get some error like "arithmetic exception, numeric overflow, or string
truncation. Cannot transliterate character between character sets" (this
occurs when you try use some character with accents) when using this and
after |ibase_query| you must set the character set (i.e. ISO8859_1 or your
current character set).

See also |ibase_errmsg|, |ibase_fetch_row|, |ibase_fetch_object|, and
|ibase_free_result|.
