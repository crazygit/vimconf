fbsql_connect -- Open a connection to a FrontBase Server

  resource fbsql_connect([string hostname [, string username [, string password]]])~

Returns a positive FrontBase link identifier on success, or an error message
on failure.

|fbsql_connect| establishes a connection to a FrontBase server. The following
defaults are assumed for missing optional parameters: {hostname} = 'NULL',
{username} = '_SYSTEM' and {password} = empty password.

If a second call is made to |fbsql_connect| with the same arguments, no new
link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling |fbsql_close|.

|fbsql_connect| example

<?php >
      $link = fbsql_connect("localhost", "_SYSTEM", "secret")
          or die("Could not connect");
      echo "Connected successfully";
      fbsql_close($link);
?>

See also |fbsql_pconnect| and |fbsql_close|.
