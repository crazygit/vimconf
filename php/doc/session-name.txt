session_name -- Get and/or set the current session name

  string session_name([string name])~

|session_name| returns the name of the current session. If {name} is
specified, the name of the current session is changed to its value.

The session name references the session id in cookies and URLs. It should
contain only alphanumeric characters; it should be short and descriptive
(i.e. for users with enabled cookie warnings). The session name is reset to
the default value stored in session.name at request startup time. Thus, you
need to call |session_name| for every request (and before |session_start| or
|session_register| are called).

Session name can't consist only from digits, at least one letter must be
present. Otherwise new session id is generated every time.

|session_name| examples

<?php >
  /* set the session name to WebsiteID */
  
  $previous_name = session_name("WebsiteID");
  
  echo "The previous session name was $previous_name<br />";
?>
