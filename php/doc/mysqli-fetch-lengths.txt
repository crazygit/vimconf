result->lengths -- Returns the lengths of the columns of the current row in
the result set

Procedural style:

  array mysqli_fetch_lengths(mysqli_result result)~

Object oriented style (property):

The |mysqli_fetch_lengths| function returns an array containing the lengths of
every column of the current row within the result set represented by the
{result} parameter. If successful, a numerically indexed array representing
the lengths of each column is returned or FALSE on failure.

An array of integers representing the size of each column (not including any
terminating null characters). FALSE if an error occurred.

|mysqli_fetch_lengths| is valid only for the current row of the result set. It
returns FALSE if you call it before calling mysqli_fetch_row/array/object or
after retrieving all rows in the result.

Object oriented style

<?php >
  $mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");
  
  /* check connection */
  if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
      printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
      exit();
  }
  
  $query = "SELECT * from Country ORDER BY Code LIMIT 1";
  
  if ($result = $mysqli->query($query)) {
  
      $row = $result->fetch_row();
  
      /* display column lengths */
      foreach ($result->lengths as $i => $val) {
          printf("Field %2d has Length %2d\n", $i+1, $val);
      }
      $result->close();
  }
  
  /* close connection */
  $mysqli->close();
?>

Procedural style

<?php >
  $link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");
  
  /* check connection */
  if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
      printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
      exit();
  }
  
  $query = "SELECT * from Country ORDER BY Code LIMIT 1";
  
  if ($result = mysqli_query($link, $query)) {
  
      $row = mysqli_fetch_row($result);
  
      /* display column lengths */
      foreach (mysqli_fetch_lengths($result) as $i => $val) {
          printf("Field %2d has Length %2d\n", $i+1, $val);
      }
      mysqli_free_result($result);
  }
  
  /* close connection */
  mysqli_close($link);
?>

The above example will output:

  Field  1 has Length  3
  Field  2 has Length  5
  Field  3 has Length 13
  Field  4 has Length  9
  Field  5 has Length  6
  Field  6 has Length  1
  Field  7 has Length  6
  Field  8 has Length  4
  Field  9 has Length  6
  Field 10 has Length  6
  Field 11 has Length  5
  Field 12 has Length 44
  Field 13 has Length  7
  Field 14 has Length  3
  Field 15 has Length  2
