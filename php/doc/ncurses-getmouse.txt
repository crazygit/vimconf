this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|ncurses_getmouse| reads mouse event out of queue. Function |ncurses_getmouse|

otherwise it will return TRUE. Event options will be delivered in parameter
{mevent}, which has to be an array, passed by reference (see example below).
On success an associative array with following keys will be delivered: "id" :
Id to distinguish multiple devices

"x" : screen relative x-position in character cells

"z" : currently not supported

"mmask" : Mouse action
