lob->write -- Writes data to the large object

  int lob->write(string data [, int length])~

Writes data from the parameter {data} into the current position of LOB's
internal pointer. If the parameter {length} is given, writing will stop after
{length} bytes have been written or the end of {data} is reached, whichever
comes first.

|lob->write| returns the number of bytes written or FALSE in case of error.
