mssql_close -- Close MS SQL Server connection

  bool mssql_close([resource link_identifier])~

|mssql_close| closes the link to a MS SQL Server database that's associated
with the specified link identifier. If the link identifier isn't specified,
the last opened link is assumed.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Note that this isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution.

|mssql_close| will not close persistent links generated by |mssql_pconnect|.

See also |mssql_connect|, and |mssql_pconnect|.
