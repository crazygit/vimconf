htmlspecialchars -- Convert special characters to HTML entities

  string htmlspecialchars(string string [, int quote_style [, string charset]])~

Certain characters have special significance in HTML, and should be
represented by HTML entities if they are to preserve their meanings. This
function returns a string with some of these conversions made; the
translations made are those most useful for everyday web programming. If you
require all HTML character entities to be translated, use |htmlentities|
instead.

This function is useful in preventing user-supplied text from containing HTML
markup, such as in a message board or guest book application. The optional
second argument, {quote_style}, tells the function what to do with single and
double quote characters. The default mode, ENT_COMPAT, is the backwards
compatible mode which only translates the double-quote character and leaves
the single-quote untranslated. If ENT_QUOTES is set, both single and double
quotes are translated and if ENT_NOQUOTES is set neither single nor double
quotes are translated.
