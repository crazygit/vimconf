PDOStatement::columnCount -- Returns the number of columns in the result set

  int PDOStatement::columnCount()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

Use |PDOStatement::columnCount| to return the number of columns in the result
set represented by the PDOStatement object.

If the PDOStatement object was returned from |PDO::query|, the column count is
immediately available.

If the PDOStatement object was returned from |PDO::prepare|, an accurate
column count will not be available until you invoke |PDOStatement::execute|.

Returns the number of columns in the result set represented by the
PDOStatement object. If there is no result set, |PDOStatement::columnCount|
returns 0.

Counting columns This example demonstrates how |PDOStatement::columnCount|
operates with and without a result set.

<?php >
  $dbh = new PDO('odbc:sample', 'db2inst1', 'ibmdb2');
  
  $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT name, colour FROM fruit");
  
  /* Count the number of columns in the (non-existent) result set */
  $colcount = $sth->columnCount();
  print("Before execute(), result set has $colcount columns (should be 0)\n");
  
  $sth->execute();
  
  /* Count the number of columns in the result set */
  $colcount = $sth->columnCount();
  print("After execute(), result set has $colcount columns (should be 2)\n");
?>

The above example will output:

  Before execute(), result set has 0 columns (should be 0)
  After execute(), result set has 2 columns (should be 2)

|PDO::prepare| |PDOStatement::execute| |PDOStatement::rowCount|
