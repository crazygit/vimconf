sesam_commit -- Commit pending updates to the SESAM database

  bool sesam_commit()~

Returns: TRUE on success, FALSE on errors

|sesam_commit| commits any pending updates to the database.

Note that there is no "auto-commit" feature as in other databases, as it could
lead to accidental data loss. Uncommitted data at the end of the current
script (or when calling |sesam_disconnect|) will be discarded by an implied
|sesam_rollback| call.

          die("insert failed");
      if (!sesam_commit())
          die("commit failed");
  }
