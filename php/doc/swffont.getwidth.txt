swffont->getwidth -- Returns the string's width

  float swffont->getwidth(string string)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swffont->getwidth| returns the string {string}'s width, using font's default
scaling. You'll probably want to use the |swftext| version of this method
which uses the text object's scale.
