imagerotate -- Rotate an image with a given angle

  resource imagerotate(resource src_im, float angle, int bgd_color [, int ignore_transparent])~

Rotates the {src_im} image using a given {angle} in degrees. {bgd_color}
specifies the color of the uncovered zone after the rotation.

The center of rotation is the center of the image, and the rotated image is
scaled down so that the whole rotated image fits in the destination image -
the edges are not clipped.

If {ignore_transparent} is set and non-zero, transparent colors are ignored
(otherwise kept). This parameter was added in PHP 5.1.

Rotate an image 180 degrees This example rotates an image 180 degrees - upside
down.

  // File and rotation
  $filename = 'test.jpg';
  $degrees = 180;
  
  // Content type
  header('Content-type: image/jpeg');
  
  // Load
  $source = imagecreatefromjpeg($filename);
  
  // Rotate
  $rotate = imagerotate($source, $degrees, 0);
  
  // Output
  imagejpeg($rotate);

This function is only available if PHP is compiled with the bundled version of
the GD library.
