rename -- Renames a file or directory

  bool rename(string oldname, string newname [, resource context])~

Attempts to rename {oldname} to {newname}.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Example with |rename|

<?php >
  rename("/tmp/tmp_file.txt", "/home/user/login/docs/my_file.txt");
?>

Prior to PHP 4.3.3, |rename| could not rename files across partitions on *nix
based systems.

As of PHP 5.0.0 |rename| can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer to for
a listing of which wrappers support |rename|.

The wrapper used in {oldname} MUST match the wrapper used in {newname}.

Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of contexts, refer
to .

See also |copy|, |unlink|, and |move_uploaded_file|.
