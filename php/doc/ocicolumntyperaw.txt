ocicolumntyperaw -- Tell the raw oracle data type of a column

  int ocicolumntyperaw(resource stmt, int col)~

|ocicolumntyperaw| returns Oracle's raw data type of the field.

This function was renamed to |oci_field_type_raw| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For
downward compatibility |ocicolumntyperaw| can also be used. This is
deprecated, however.
