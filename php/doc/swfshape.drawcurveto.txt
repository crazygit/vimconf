SWFShape->drawCurveTo -- Draws a curve

  int swfshape->drawcurveto(int controlx, int controly, int anchorx, int anchory [, int targetx, int targety])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfshape->drawcurveto| draws a quadratic curve (using the current line style,
set by |swfshape->setline|) from the current pen position to
({anchorx},{anchory}) using ({controlx},{controly}) as a control point. That
is, head towards the control point, then smoothly turn to the anchor point.

With 6 parameters, it draws a cubic bezier to point ({targetx}, {targety})
with control points ({controlx}, {controly}) and ({anchorx}, {anchory}).

and |swfshape->movepen|.
