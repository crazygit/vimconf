swf_shapecurveto -- Draw a quadratic bezier curve between two points

  void swf_shapecurveto(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2)~

The |swf_shapecurveto| function draws a quadratic bezier curve from the
current location, though the x coordinate given by {x1} and the y coordinate
given by {y1} to the x coordinate given by {x2} and the y coordinate given by
{y2}. The current position is then set to the x,y coordinates given by the
{x2} and {y2} parameters
