sybase_query -- Sends a Sybase query

  mixed sybase_query(string query [, resource link_identifier])~

Returns a positive Sybase result identifier on success, FALSE on error, or
TRUE if the query was successful but didn't return any columns.

|sybase_query| sends a query to the currently active database on the server
that's associated with the specified link identifier. If the link identifier
isn't specified, the last opened link is assumed. If no link is open, the
function tries to establish a link as if |sybase_connect| was called, and use
it.

See also |sybase_select_db| and |sybase_connect|.
