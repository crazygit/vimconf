ldap_get_entries -- Get all result entries

  array ldap_get_entries(resource link_identifier, resource result_identifier)~

Returns a complete result information in a multi-dimensional array on success
and FALSE on error.

|ldap_get_entries| function is used to simplify reading multiple entries from
the result, specified with {result_identifier}, and then reading the
attributes and multiple values. The entire information is returned by one
function call in a multi-dimensional array. The structure of the array is as
follows.

The attribute index is converted to lowercase. (Attributes are
case-insensitive for directory servers, but not when used as array indices.)

  return_value["count"] = number of entries in the result
  return_value[0] : refers to the details of first entry
  
  return_value[i]["dn"] =  DN of the ith entry in the result
  
  return_value[i]["count"] = number of attributes in ith entry
  return_value[i][j] = jth attribute in the ith entry in the result
  
  return_value[i]["attribute"]["count"] = number of values for 
                                          attribute in ith entry
  return_value[i]["attribute"][j] = jth value of attribute in ith entry
