lob->close -- Closes LOB descriptor

  bool lob->close()~

|lob->close| closes descriptor of LOB or FILE. This function should be used
only with |lob->writeTemporary|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocicloselob| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_lob_close| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

See also |oci_lob_write_temporary|.
