phpcredits -- Prints out the credits for PHP

  bool phpcredits([int flag])~

This function prints out the credits listing the PHP developers, modules, etc.
It generates the appropriate HTML codes to insert the information in a page.
{flag} is optional, and it defaults to CREDITS_ALL. To generate a custom
credits page, you may want to use the {flag} parameter. For example to print
the general credits, you will use somewhere in your code:

<?php >
  phpcredits(CREDITS_GENERAL);
?>

And if you want to print the core developers and the documentation group, in a
page of its own, you will use:

<?php >
  phpcredits(CREDITS_GROUP + CREDITS_DOCS + CREDITS_FULLPAGE);
?>

And if you feel like embedding all the credits in your page, then code like
the one below will do it:

  <html>
   <head>
    <title>My credits page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
<?php >
  // some code of your own
  phpcredits(CREDITS_ALL - CREDITS_FULLPAGE);
  // some more code
?>
   </body>
  </html>
