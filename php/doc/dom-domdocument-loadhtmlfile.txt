DOMDocument->loadHTMLFile() -- Load HTML from a file

  bool loadHTMLFile(string filename)~

The function parses the HTML document in the file named {filename}. Unlike
loading XML, HTML does not have to be well-formed to load.

This function may also be called statically to load and create a DOMDocument
object. The static invocation may be used when no DOMDocument properties need
to be set prior to loading.

{filename} The path to the HTML file.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

  $doc->loadHTMLFile("filename.html");

?>
