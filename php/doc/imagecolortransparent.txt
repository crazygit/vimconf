imagecolortransparent -- Define a color as transparent

  int imagecolortransparent(resource image [, int color])~

|imagecolortransparent| sets the transparent color in the {image} image to
{color}. {image} is the image identifier returned by |imagecreate| and
{color} is a color identifier returned by |imagecolorallocate|.

The transparent color is a property of the image, transparency is not a
property of the color. Once you have set a color to be the transparent color,
any regions of the image in that color that were drawn previously will be
transparent.

The identifier of the new (or current, if none is specified) transparent color
is returned.

Transparency is copied only with |imagecopymerge| and true color images, not
with |imagecopy| or pallete images.
