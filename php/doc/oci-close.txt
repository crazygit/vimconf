oci_close -- Closes Oracle connection

  bool oci_close(resource connection)~

|oci_close| closes the Oracle connection {connection}.

As non-persistent links are closed automatically at the end of script
execution, calling this function is not required. Because of this and the
method the extension uses to handle connection resources, |oci_close|
currently provides no actual functionality.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ociclose| instead. This name still
can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_close| for downwards compatability.
This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
