oci_rollback -- Rolls back outstanding transaction

  bool oci_rollback(resource connection)~

|oci_rollback| rolls back all outstanding statements for Oracle connection
{connection}.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocirollback| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_rollback| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

See also |oci_commit|.
