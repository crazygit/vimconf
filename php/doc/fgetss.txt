fgetss -- Gets line from file pointer and strip HTML tags

  string fgetss(resource handle [, int length [, string allowable_tags]])~

Identical to |fgets|, except that fgetss attempts to strip any HTML and PHP
tags from the text it reads.

You can use the optional third parameter to specify tags which should not be
stripped. {allowable_tags} was added in PHP 3.0.13, PHP 4.0.0.

Parameter {length} is optional since PHP 5.

If you are having problems with PHP not recognizing the line endings when
reading files either on or created by a Macintosh computer, you might want to
enable the auto_detect_line_endings run-time configuration option.

See also |fgets|, |fopen|, |fsockopen|, |popen|, and |strip_tags|.
