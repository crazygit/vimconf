sybase_connect -- Opens a Sybase server connection

  resource sybase_connect([string servername [, string username [, string password [, string charset [, string appname]]]]])~

Returns a positive Sybase link identifier on success, or FALSE on failure.

|sybase_connect| establishes a connection to a Sybase server. The servername
argument has to be a valid servername that is defined in the 'interfaces'
file.

In case a second call is made to |sybase_connect| with the same arguments, no
new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling |sybase_close|.

|sybase_connect| example

<?php >
  $link = sybase_connect('SYBASE', '', '')
          or die("Could not connect !");
  echo "Connected successfully";
  sybase_close($link);
?>

See also |sybase_pconnect| and |sybase_close|.
