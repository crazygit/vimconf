odbc_free_result -- Free resources associated with a result

  bool odbc_free_result(resource result_id)~

Always returns TRUE.

|odbc_free_result| only needs to be called if you are worried about using too
much memory while your script is running. All result memory will
automatically be freed when the script is finished. But, if you are sure you
are not going to need the result data anymore in a script, you may call
|odbc_free_result|, and the memory associated with {result_id} will be freed.

If auto-commit is disabled (see |odbc_autocommit|) and you call
|odbc_free_result| before committing, all pending transactions are rolled
back.
