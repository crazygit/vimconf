mssql_field_length -- Get the length of a field

  int mssql_field_length(resource result [, int offset])~

This function returns the length of field no. {offset} in result {result}. If
{offset} is omitted, the current field is used.

Due to a limitation in the underlying API used by PHP (MS DbLib C API), the
length of VARCHAR fields is limited to 255. If you need to store more data,
use a TEXT field instead.
