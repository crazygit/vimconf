ifx_pconnect -- Open persistent Informix connection

  int ifx_pconnect([string database [, string userid [, string password]]])~

Returns: A positive Informix persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE
on error

|ifx_pconnect| acts very much like |ifx_connect| with two major differences.

This function behaves exactly like |ifx_connect| when PHP is not running as an
Apache module. First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a
(persistent) link that's already open with the same host, username and
password. If one is found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of
opening a new connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(|ifx_close| will not close links established by |ifx_pconnect|).

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.

See also: |ifx_connect|.
