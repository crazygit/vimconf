lob->append -- Appends data from the large object to another large object

  bool lob->append(OCI-Lob lob_from)~

Appends data from the large object to the end of another large object.

Writing to the large object with |lob->append| will fail if buffering was
previously enabled. You must disable buffering before appending. You may need
to flush buffers with |oci_lob_flush| before disabling buffering.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
