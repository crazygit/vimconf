fnmatch -- Match filename against a pattern

  bool fnmatch(string pattern, string string [, int flags])~

|fnmatch| checks if the passed {string} would match the given shell wildcard
{pattern}.

This is especially useful for filenames, but may also be used on regular
strings. The average user may be used to shell patterns or at least in their
simplest form to '?' and '*' wildcards so using |fnmatch| instead of |ereg|
or |preg_match| for frontend search expression input may be way more
convenient for non-programming users.

Checking a color name against a shell wildcard pattern.

<?php >
  if (fnmatch("*gr[ae]y", $color)) {
    echo "some form of gray ...";
  }
?>

For now this function is not available on Windows or other non-POSIX compliant
systems.

See also |glob|, |ereg|, |preg_match| and the Unix manpage on fnmatch(3) for
flag names (as long as they are not documented here ).
