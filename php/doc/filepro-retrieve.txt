filepro_retrieve -- Retrieves data from a filePro database

  string filepro_retrieve(int row_number, int field_number)~

Returns the data from the specified location in the database. The {row_number}
parameter must be between zero and the total number of rows minus one
(0..|filepro_rowcount| - 1). Likewise, {field_number} accepts values between
zero and the total number of fields minus one (0..|filepro_fieldcount| - 1)

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories you are
about to operate on have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being
executed.
