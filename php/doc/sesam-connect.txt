sesam_connect -- Open SESAM database connection

  bool sesam_connect(string catalog, string schema, string user)~

Returns TRUE if a connection to the SESAM database was made, or FALSE on
error.

|sesam_connect| establishes a connection to an SESAM database handler task.
The connection is always "persistent" in the sense that only the very first
invocation will actually load the driver from the configured SESAM OML PLAM
library. Subsequent calls will reuse the driver and will immediately use the
given catalog, schema, and user.

When creating a database, the {"catalog"} name is specified in the SESAM
configuration directive //ADD-SQL-DATABASE-CATALOG-LIST ENTRY-1 =
*CATALOG(CATALOG-NAME = catalogname,...)

The {"schema"} references the desired database schema (see SESAM handbook).

The {"user"} argument references one of the users which are allowed to access
this {"catalog"} / {"schema"} combination. Note that {"user"} is completely
independent from both the system's user id's and from HTTP user/password
protection. It appears in the SESAM configuration only.
