this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own

it means a 45-degree forward slant. More is more upward, less is more
downward.

The object may be a |swfshape|, a |swfbutton|, a |swftext| or a |swfsprite|
object. It must have been added using the |swfmovie->add|.
