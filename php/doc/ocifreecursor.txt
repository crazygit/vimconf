ocifreecursor -- Free all resources associated with a cursor

  bool ocifreecursor(resource stmt)~

|ocifreecursor| frees all resources associated with the cursor {stmt}. Returns
TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

This function was renamed to |oci_free_cursor| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For
downward compatibility |ocifreecursor| can also be used. This is deprecated,
however.
