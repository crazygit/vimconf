ceil -- Round fractions up

  float ceil(float value)~

Returns the next highest integer value by rounding up {value} if necessary.
The return value of |ceil| is still of type float as the value range of float
is usually bigger than that of integer.

|ceil| example

<?php >
  echo ceil(4.3);    // 5
  echo ceil(9.999);  // 10
?>

See also |floor| and |round|.
