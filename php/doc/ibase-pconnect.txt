ibase_pconnect -- Open a persistent connection to an InterBase database

  resource ibase_pconnect([string database [, string username [, string password [, string charset [, int buffers [, int dialect [, string role [, int sync]]]]]]]])~

|ibase_pconnect| acts very much like |ibase_connect| with two major
differences. First, when connecting, the function will first try to find a
(persistent) link that's already opened with the same parameters. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection. Second, the connection to the InterBase server will not be closed
when the execution of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for
future use (|ibase_close| will not close links established by
|ibase_pconnect|). This type of link is therefore called 'persistent'.

{buffers} was added in PHP 4.0.0.

{dialect} was added in PHP 4.0.0. It is functional only with InterBase 6 and
versions higher than that.

{role} was added in PHP 4.0.0. It is functional only with InterBase 5 and
versions higher than that.

See also |ibase_close| and |ibase_connect| for the meaning of parameters
passed to this function. They are exactly the same.
