strpos -- Find position of first occurrence of a string

  int strpos(string haystack, mixed needle [, int offset])~

Returns the numeric position of the first occurrence of {needle} in the
{haystack} string. Unlike the |strrpos|, this function can take a full string
as the {needle} parameter and the entire string will be used.

If {needle} is not found, |strpos| will return boolean FALSE.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.

This function is binary-safe.

|strpos| examples

<?php >
  $mystring = 'abc';
  $findme   = 'a';
  $pos = strpos($mystring, $findme);
  
  // Note our use of ===.  Simply == would not work as expected
  // because the position of 'a' was the 0th (first) character.
  if ($pos === false) {
      echo "The string '$findme' was not found in the string '$mystring'";
  } else {
      echo "The string '$findme' was found in the string '$mystring'";
      echo " and exists at position $pos";
  }
  
  // We can search for the character, ignoring anything before the offset
  $newstring = 'abcdef abcdef';
  $pos = strpos($newstring, 'a', 1); // $pos = 7, not 0
?>

If {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an integer and applied as the
ordinal value of a character.

The optional {offset} parameter allows you to specify which character in
{haystack} to start searching. The position returned is still relative to the
beginning of {haystack}.
