xdiff_file_patch -- Patch a file with an unified diff

  mixed xdiff_file_patch(string file, string patch, string dest [, int flags])~

|xdiff_file_patch| patches file {file} with unified patch in file {patch} and
stores result in file {dest}.

{flags} can be either XDIFF_PATCH_NORMAL (default mode, normal patch) or
XDIFF_PATCH_REVERSE (reversed patch).

Returns FALSE if an internal error happened, string with rejected chunks of
patch or TRUE if patch has been successfully applied.

|xdiff_file_patch| example The following code applies unified diff to a file.

<?php >
  $old_version = 'my_script-1.0.php';
  $patch = 'my_script.patch';
  
  $errors = xdiff_file_patch($old_version, $patch, 'my_script-1.1.php');
  if (is_string($errors)) {
     echo "Rejects:\n";
     echo $errors;
  }
?>

Patch reversing example The following code reverses a patch.

<?php >
  $new_version = 'my_script-1.1.php';
  $patch = 'my_script.patch';
  
  $errors = xdiff_file_patch($new_version, $patch, 'my_script-1.0.php', XDIFF_PATCH_REVERSE);
  if (is_string($errors)) {
     echo "Rejects:\n";
     echo $errors;
  }
?>
