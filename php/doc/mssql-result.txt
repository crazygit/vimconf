mssql_result -- Get result data

  string mssql_result(resource result, int row, mixed field)~

|mssql_result| returns the contents of one cell from a MS SQL result set. The
field argument can be the field's offset, the field's name or the field's
table dot field's name (tablename.fieldname). If the column name has been
aliased ('select foo as bar from...'), it uses the alias instead of the
column name.

When working on large result sets, you should consider using one of the
functions that fetch an entire row (specified below). As these functions
return the contents of multiple cells in one function call, they're MUCH
quicker than |mssql_result|. Also, note that specifying a numeric offset for
the field argument is much quicker than specifying a fieldname or
tablename.fieldname argument.

Recommended high-performance alternatives: |mssql_fetch_row|,
|mssql_fetch_array|, and |mssql_fetch_object|.
