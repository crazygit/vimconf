printer_open -- Open connection to a printer

  resource printer_open([string devicename])~

This function tries to open a connection to the printer {devicename}, and
returns a handle on success or FALSE on failure.

If no parameter was given it tries to open a connection to the default printer
(if not specified in php.ini as printer.default_printer, PHP tries to detect
it).

|printer_open| also starts a device context.

|printer_open| example

<?php >
  $handle = printer_open("HP Deskjet 930c");
  $handle = printer_open();
?>
