oci_parse -- Prepares Oracle statement for execution

  resource oci_parse(resource connection, string query)~

|oci_parse| prepares the {query} using {connection} and returns the statement
identifier, which can be used with |oci_bind_by_name|, |oci_execute| and
other functions.

This function does not validate {query}. The only way to find out if {query}
is valid SQL or PL/SQL statement - is to execute it.

|oci_parse| returns FALSE on error.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ociparse| instead. This name still
can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_parse| for downwards compatability.
This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
