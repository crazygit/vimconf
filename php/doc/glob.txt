glob -- Find pathnames matching a pattern

  array glob(string pattern [, int flags])~

The |glob| function searches for all the pathnames matching {pattern}
according to the rules used by the libc glob() function, which is similar to
the rules used by common shells. No tilde expansion or parameter substitution
is done.

Returns an array containing the matched files/directories or FALSE on error.

Valid flags: GLOB_MARK - Adds a slash to each item returned

GLOB_NOSORT - Return files as they appear in the directory (no sorting)

GLOB_NOCHECK - Return the search pattern if no files matching it were found

GLOB_NOESCAPE - Backslashes do not quote metacharacters

GLOB_BRACE - Expands {a,b,c} to match 'a', 'b', or 'c'

GLOB_ONLYDIR - Return only directory entries which match the pattern

Before PHP 4.3.3 GLOB_ONLYDIR was not available on Windows and other systems
not using the GNU C library.

GLOB_ERR - Stop on read errors (like unreadable directories), by default
errors are ignored

GLOB_ERR was added in PHP 5.1

Convenient way how |glob| can replace |opendir| and friends.

<?php >
  foreach (glob("*.txt") as $filename) {
      echo "$filename size " . filesize($filename) . "\n";
  }
?>

Output will look something like:

  funclist.txt size 44686
  funcsummary.txt size 267625
  quickref.txt size 137820

This function will not work on remote files as the file to be examined must be
accessible via the servers filesystem.

See also |opendir|, |readdir|, |closedir|, and |fnmatch|.
