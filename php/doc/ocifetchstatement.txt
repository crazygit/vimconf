ocifetchstatement -- Fetch all rows of result data into an array

  int ocifetchstatement(resource stmt, array output [, int skip [, int maxrows [, int flags]]])~

In PHP 5.0.0 this function became an alias for |oci_fetch_all|. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_fetch_all| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

See also |oci_fetch_array|, |oci_fetch_assoc|, |oci_fetch_object|,
|oci_fetch_row|.
