fileatime -- Gets last access time of file

  int fileatime(string filename)~

Returns the time the file was last accessed, or FALSE in case of an error. The
time is returned as a Unix timestamp.

Note: The atime of a file is supposed to change whenever the data blocks of a
file are being read. This can be costly performance-wise when an application
regularly accesses a very large number of files or directories. Some Unix
filesystems can be mounted with atime updates disabled to increase the
performance of such applications; USENET news spools are a common example. On
such filesystems this function will be useless.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0 this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.

|fileatime| example

<?php >
  // outputs e.g.  somefile.txt was last accessed: December 29 2002 22:16:23.
  
  $filename = 'somefile.txt';
  if (file_exists($filename)) {
      echo "$filename was last accessed: " . date("F d Y H:i:s.", fileatime($filename));
  }
?>
