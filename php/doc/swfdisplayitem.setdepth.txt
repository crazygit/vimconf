SWFDisplayItem->setDepth -- Sets z-order

  void swfdisplayitem->setdepth(float depth)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfdisplayitem->setdepth| sets the object's z-order to {depth}. Depth
defaults to the order in which instances are created (by adding a shape/text
to a movie)- newer ones are on top of older ones. If two objects are given
the same depth, only the later-defined one can be moved.

The object may be a |swfshape|, a |swfbutton|, a |swftext| or a |swfsprite|
object. It must have been added using the |swfmovie->add|.
