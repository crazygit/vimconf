pcntl_setpriority -- Change the priority of any process

  bool pcntl_setpriority(int priority [, int pid [, int process_identifier]])~

|pcntl_setpriority| sets the priority of {pid} to {priority}. If {pid} is not
specified, the pid of the current process is used.

{priority} is generally a value in the range -20 to 20. The default priority
is 0 while a lower numerical value causes more favorable scheduling. Because
priority levels can differ between system types and kernel versions, please
see your system's setpriority(2) man page for specific details.

{process_identifier} is one of PRIO_PGRP, PRIO_USER or PRIO_PROCESS.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
