fbsql_affected_rows -- Get number of affected rows in previous FrontBase
operation

  int fbsql_affected_rows([resource link_identifier])~

|fbsql_affected_rows| returns the number of rows affected by the last INSERT,
UPDATE or DELETE query associated with {link_identifier}. If the link
identifier isn't specified, the last link opened by |fbsql_connect| is
assumed.

If you are using transactions, you need to call |fbsql_affected_rows| after
your INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE query, not after the commit.

If the last query was a DELETE query with no WHERE clause, all of the records
will have been deleted from the table but this function will return zero.

When using UPDATE, FrontBase will not update columns where the new value is
the same as the old value. This creates the possibility that
|fbsql_affected_rows| may not actually equal the number of rows matched, only
the number of rows that were literally affected by the query.

If the last query failed, this function will return -1.
