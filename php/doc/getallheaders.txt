This function is an alias for |apache_request_headers|. Please read the
|apache_request_headers| documentation for more information on how this
function works.

This function is only supported when PHP is installed as an Apache module.

An associative array of all the HTTP headers in the current request, or FALSE
on failure.

Version Description 4.3.0 Became an alias for |apache_request_headers|.
Essentially, it was renamed. This is because this function only works with
Apache.

Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE webservers, too.
