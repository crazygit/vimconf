ldap_free_result -- Free result memory

  bool ldap_free_result(resource result_identifier)~

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|ldap_free_result| frees up the memory allocated internally to store the
result and pointed by the {result_identifier}. All result memory will be
automatically freed when the script terminates.

Typically all the memory allocated for the ldap result gets freed at the end
of the script. In case the script is making successive searches which return
large result sets, |ldap_free_result| could be called to keep the runtime
memory usage by the script low.
