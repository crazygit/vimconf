strrchr -- Find the last occurrence of a character in a string

  string strrchr(string haystack, string needle)~

This function returns the portion of {haystack} which starts at the last
occurrence of {needle} and goes until the end of {haystack}.

Returns FALSE if {needle} is not found.

If {needle} contains more than one character, only the first is used in PHP 4.
This behavior is different from that of |strchr|.

If {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an integer and applied as the
ordinal value of a character. |strrchr| example

<?php >
  // get last directory in $PATH
  $dir = substr(strrchr($PATH, ":"), 1);
  
  // get everything after last newline
  $text = "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3";
  $last = substr(strrchr($text, 10), 1 );
?>

|strrchr| has been binary safe since PHP 4.3.0

See also |strstr|, |substr|, and |stristr|.
