swf_polarview -- Define the viewer's position with polar coordinates

  void swf_polarview(float dist, float azimuth, float incidence, float twist)~

The |swf_polarview| function defines the viewer's position in polar
coordinates. The {dist} parameter gives the distance between the viewpoint to
the world space origin. The {azimuth} parameter defines the azimuthal angle in
the x,y coordinate plane, measured in distance from the y axis. The
{incidence} parameter defines the angle of incidence in the y,z plane,
measured in distance from the z axis. The incidence angle is defined as the
angle of the viewport relative to the z axis. Finally the {twist} specifies
the amount that the viewpoint is to be rotated about the line of sight using
the right hand rule.
