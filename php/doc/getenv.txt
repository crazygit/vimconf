getenv -- Gets the value of an environment variable

  string getenv(string varname)~

Returns the value of the environment variable {varname}, or FALSE on an error.

<?php >
  // Example use of getenv()
  $ip = getenv('REMOTE_ADDR');
  
  // Or simply use a Superglobal ($_SERVER or $_ENV)
  $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
?>

You can see a list of all the environmental variables by using |phpinfo|. You
can find out what many of them mean by taking a look at the CGI
specification, specifically the page on environmental variables.

See also |putenv|, |apache_getenv| and Superglobals.
