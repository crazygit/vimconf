oci_connect -- Establishes a connection to Oracle server

  resource oci_connect(string username, string password [, string db [, string charset]])~

|oci_connect| returns a connection identifier needed for most other OCI calls.
The optional third parameter can either contain the name of the local Oracle
instance or the name of the entry in tnsnames.ora to which you want to
connect. If the optional third parameter is not specified, PHP uses the
environment variables ORACLE_SID (Oracle instance) or TWO_TASK (tnsnames.ora)
to determine which database to connect to.

|oci_connect| does not reestablish the connection, if a connection with such
parameters was established before. In this case, |oci_connect| will return
identifier of previously opened connection. This means, that you cannot use
this function to separate transactions. To establish a distinctly new
connection, use |oci_new_connect|.
