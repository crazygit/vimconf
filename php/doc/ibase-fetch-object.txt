ibase_fetch_object -- Get an object from a InterBase database

  object ibase_fetch_object(resource result_id [, int fetch_flag])~

Fetches a row as a pseudo-object from a {result_id} obtained either by
|ibase_query| or |ibase_execute|.

<?php >
      $dbh = ibase_connect($host, $username, $password);
      $stmt = 'SELECT * FROM tblname';
      $sth = ibase_query($dbh, $stmt);
      while ($row = ibase_fetch_object($sth)) {
          echo $row->email . "\n";
      }
      ibase_close($dbh);
?>

Subsequent calls to |ibase_fetch_object| return the next row in the result
set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.

{fetch_flag} is a combination of the constants IBASE_TEXT and IBASE_UNIXTIME
ORed together. Passing IBASE_TEXT will cause this function to return BLOB
contents instead of BLOB ids. Passing IBASE_UNIXTIME will cause this function
to return date/time values as Unix timestamps instead of as formatted strings.

See also |ibase_fetch_row| and |ibase_fetch_assoc|.
