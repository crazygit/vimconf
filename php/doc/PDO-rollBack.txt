PDO::rollBack -- Rolls back a transaction

  bool PDO::rollBack()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

Rolls back the current transaction, as initiated by |PDO::beginTransaction|.
It is an error to call this method if no transaction is active.

If the database was set to autocommit mode, this function will restore
autocommit mode after it has rolled back the transaction.

Roll back a transaction

<?php >
  /* Begin a transaction, turning off autocommit */
  $dbh->beginTransaction();
  
  /* Change the database schema and data */
  $sth = $dbh->exec("DROP TABLE fruit");
  $sth = $dbh->exec("UPDATE dessert
      SET name = 'hamburger'");
  
  /* Recognize mistake and roll back changes */
  $dbh->rollBack();
  
  /* Database connection is now back in autocommit mode */
?>
