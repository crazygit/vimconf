oci_new_collection -- Allocates new collection object

  OCI-Collection oci_new_collection(resource connection, string tdo [, string schema])~

Allocates new collection object. Parameter {tdo} should be a valid named type
(uppercased). Third, optional parameter {schema} should point to the scheme,
where the named type was created. |oci_new_collection| uses name of the
current user as default value of {schema}.

|oci_new_collection| returns FALSE on error.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocinewcollection| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_new_collection| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
