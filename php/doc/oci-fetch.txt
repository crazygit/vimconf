oci_fetch -- Fetches the next row into result-buffer

  bool oci_fetch(resource statement)~

|oci_fetch| fetches the next row (for SELECT statements) into the internal
result-buffer.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocifetch| instead. This name still
can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_fetch| for downwards compatability.
This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
