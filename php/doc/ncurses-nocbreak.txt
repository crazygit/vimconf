  bool ncurses_nocbreak()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|ncurses_nocbreak| routine returns terminal to normal (cooked) mode. Initially
the terminal may or may not in cbreak mode as the mode is inherited. Therefore
a program should call |ncurses_cbreak| and |ncurses_nocbreak| explicitly.
