ob_end_flush -- Flush (send) the output buffer and turn off output buffering

  bool ob_end_flush()~

This function will send the contents of the topmost output buffer (if any) and
turn this output buffer off. If you want to further process the buffer's
contents you have to call |ob_get_contents| before |ob_end_flush| as the
buffer contents are discarded after |ob_end_flush| is called. The function
returns TRUE when it successfully discarded one buffer and FALSE otherwise.
Reasons for failure are first that you called the function without an active
buffer or that for some reason a buffer could not be deleted (possible for
special buffer).

This function is similar to |ob_get_flush|, except that |ob_get_flush| returns
the buffer as a string.

The following example shows an easy way to flush and end all output buffers:

|ob_end_flush| example

<?php >
    while (@ob_end_flush());
?>

If the function fails it generates an E_NOTICE.

The boolean return value was added in PHP 4.2.0.

|ob_end_clean|.
