lob->flush -- Flushes/writes buffer of the LOB to the server

  bool lob->flush([int flag])~

|lob->flush| actually writes data to the server. By default, resources are not
freed, but using flag OCI_LOB_BUFFER_FREE you can do it explicitly. Be sure
you know what you're doing - next read/write operation to the same part of
LOB will involve a round-trip to the server and initialize new buffer
resources. It is recommended to use OCI_LOB_BUFFER_FREE flag only when you
are not going to work with the LOB anymore.

|lob->flush| returns FALSE if buffering was not enabled or an error occurred.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
