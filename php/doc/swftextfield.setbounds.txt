SWFTextField->setbounds -- Sets the text field width and height

  void swftextfield->setbounds(int width, int height)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swftextfield->setbounds| sets the text field width to {width} and height to
{height}. If you don't set the bounds yourself, Ming makes a poor guess at
what the bounds are.
