mkdir -- Makes directory

  bool mkdir(string pathname [, int mode [, bool recursive [, resource context]]])~

Attempts to create the directory specified by pathname.

Note that you probably want to specify the mode as an octal number, which
means it should have a leading zero. The mode is also modified by the current
umask, which you can change using |umask|.

Mode is ignored on Windows, and became optional in PHP 4.2.0.

The mode is 0777 by default, which means the widest possible access. For more
information on modes, read the details on the |chmod| page. |mkdir| example

<?php >
  mkdir("/path/to/my/dir", 0700);
?>

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

As of PHP 5.0.0 |mkdir| can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer to for
a listing of which wrappers support |mkdir|.

Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of contexts, refer
to .

The {recursive} parameter was added as of PHP 5.0.0.

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the directory in which you are
about to operate has the same UID (owner) as the script that is being
executed.

See also |rmdir|.
