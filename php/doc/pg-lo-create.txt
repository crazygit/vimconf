pg_lo_create -- Create a large object

  int pg_lo_create([resource connection])~

|pg_lo_create| creates a large object and returns the OID of the large object.
PostgreSQL access modes INV_READ, INV_WRITE, and INV_ARCHIVE are not
supported, the object is created always with both read and write access.
INV_ARCHIVE has been removed from PostgreSQL itself (version 6.3 and above).

To use the large object interface, it is necessary to enclose it within a
transaction block.

Instead of using the large object interface (which has no access controls and
is cumbersome to use), try PostgreSQL's bytea column type and
|pg_escape_bytea|.

This function used to be called |pg_locreate|.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

A large object OID or FALSE on error.

     $handle = pg_lo_open($database, $oid, "w");
     echo "$handle\n";
     pg_lo_write($handle, "large object data");
