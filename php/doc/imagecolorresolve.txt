imagecolorresolve -- Get the index of the specified color or its closest
possible alternative

  int imagecolorresolve(resource image, int red, int green, int blue)~

This function is guaranteed to return a color index for a requested color,
either the exact color or the closest possible alternative.

If you created the image from a file, only colors used in the image are
resolved. Colors present only in the pallete are not resolved.

See also |imagecolorclosest|.
