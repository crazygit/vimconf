hw_InsertDocument -- Upload any document

  int hw_insertdocument(int connection, int parent_id, int hw_document)~

Uploads a document into the collection with {parent_id}. The document has to
be created before with |hw_new_document|. Make sure that the object record of
the new document contains at least the attributes: Type, DocumentType, Title

the object id of the new document or FALSE.
