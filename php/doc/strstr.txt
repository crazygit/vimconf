strstr -- Find first occurrence of a string

  string strstr(string haystack, string needle)~

Returns part of {haystack} string from the first occurrence of {needle} to the
end of {haystack}.

If {needle} is not found, returns FALSE.

If {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an integer and applied as the
ordinal value of a character.

This function is case-sensitive. For case-insensitive searches, use |stristr|.

|strstr| example

<?php >
  $email = 'user@example.com';
  $domain = strstr($email, '@');
  echo $domain; // prints @example.com
?>

If you only want to determine if a particular {needle} occurs within
{haystack}, use the faster and less memory intensive function |strpos|
instead.

|strstr| has been binary safe since PHP 4.3.0

See also |ereg|, |preg_match|, |stristr|, |strpos|, |strrchr|, and |substr|.
