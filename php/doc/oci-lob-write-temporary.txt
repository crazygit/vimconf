lob->writeTemporary -- Writes temporary large object

  bool lob->writeTemporary(string data [, int lob_type])~

Creates a temporary large object and writes {data} to it.

Parameter {lob_type} can be one of the following: OCI_TEMP_BLOB is used to
create temporary BLOBs OCI_TEMP_CLOB is used to create temporary CLOBs

|lob->writeTemporary| creates a CLOB by default.

You should use |oci_lob_close| when the work with the object is over.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ociwritetemporarylob| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_lob_write_temporary| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

See also |oci_lob_close|.
