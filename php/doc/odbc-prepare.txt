odbc_prepare -- Prepares a statement for execution

  resource odbc_prepare(resource connection_id, string query_string)~

Returns FALSE on error.

Returns an ODBC result identifier if the SQL command was prepared
successfully. The result identifier can be used later to execute the
statement with |odbc_execute|.

Some databases (such as IBM DB2, MS SQL Server, and Oracle) support stored
procedures that accept parameters of type IN, INOUT, and OUT as defined by
the ODBC specification. However, the Unified ODBC driver currently only
supports parameters of type IN to stored procedures.

In the following code, $res will only be valid if all three parameters to
myproc are IN parameters:

<?php >
  $a = 1;
  $b = 2;
  $c = 3;
  $stmt = odbc_prepare($conn, 'CALL myproc(?,?,?)');
  $res = odbc_execute($stmt, array($a, $b, $c));
?>

If you need to call a stored procedure using INOUT or OUT parameters, the
recommended workaround is to use a native extension for your database (for
example, mssql for MS SQL Server, or oci8 for Oracle).
