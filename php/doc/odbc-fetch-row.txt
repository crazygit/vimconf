odbc_fetch_row -- Fetch a row

  bool odbc_fetch_row(resource result_id [, int row_number])~

If |odbc_fetch_row| was successful (there was a row), TRUE is returned. If
there are no more rows, FALSE is returned.

|odbc_fetch_row| fetches a row of the data that was returned by |odbc_do| /
|odbc_exec|. After |odbc_fetch_row| is called, the fields of that row can be
accessed with |odbc_result|.

If {row_number} is not specified, |odbc_fetch_row| will try to fetch the next
row in the result set. Calls to |odbc_fetch_row| with and without
{row_number} can be mixed.

To step through the result more than once, you can call |odbc_fetch_row| with
{row_number} 1, and then continue doing |odbc_fetch_row| without {row_number}
to review the result. If a driver doesn't support fetching rows by number, the
{row_number} parameter is ignored.
