ncurses_mousemask -- Sets mouse options

  int ncurses_mousemask(int newmask, int oldmask)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

Function |ncurses_mousemask| will set mouse events to be reported. By default
no mouse events will be reported. The function |ncurses_mousemask| will
return a mask to indicated which of the in parameter {newmask} specified
mouse events can be reported. On complete failure, it returns 0. In parameter
{oldmask}, which is passed by reference |ncurses_mousemask| returns the
previous value of mouse event mask. Mouse events are represented by
NCURSES_KEY_MOUSE in the |ncurses_wgetch| input stream. To read the event
data and pop the event of queue, call |ncurses_getmouse|.

As a side effect, setting a zero mousemask in {newmask} turns off the mouse
pointer. Setting a non zero value turns mouse pointer on.

NCURSES_BUTTON1_PRESSED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_RELEASED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_DOUBLE_CLICKED
