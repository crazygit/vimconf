stream_set_write_buffer -- Sets file buffering on the given stream

  int stream_set_write_buffer(resource stream, int buffer)~

Output using |fwrite| is normally buffered at 8K. This means that if there are
two processes wanting to write to the same output stream (a file), each is
paused after 8K of data to allow the other to write.
|stream_set_write_buffer| sets the buffering for write operations on the
given filepointer {stream} to {buffer} bytes. If {buffer} is 0 then write
operations are unbuffered. This ensures that all writes with |fwrite| are
completed before other processes are allowed to write to that output stream.

The function returns 0 on success, or EOF if the request cannot be honored.

The following example demonstrates how to use |stream_set_write_buffer| to
create an unbuffered stream. |stream_set_write_buffer| example

<?php >
  $fp = fopen($file, "w");
  if ($fp) {
    stream_set_write_buffer($fp, 0);
    fwrite($fp, $output);
    fclose($fp);
  }
?>
