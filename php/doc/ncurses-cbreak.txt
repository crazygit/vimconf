This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|ncurses_cbreak| disables line buffering and character processing (interrupt
and flow control characters are unaffected), making characters typed by the
