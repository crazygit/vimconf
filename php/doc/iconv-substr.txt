iconv_substr -- Cut out part of a string

  string iconv_substr(string str, int offset [, int length [, string charset]])~

Returns the portion of {str} specified by the {start} and {length} parameters.

If {start} is non-negative, |iconv_substr| cuts the portion out of {str}
beginning at {start}'th character, counting from zero.

If {start} is negative, |iconv_substr| cuts out the portion beginning at the
position, {start} characters away from the end of {str}.

If {length} is given and is positive, the return value will contain at most
{length} characters of the portion that begins at {start} (depending on the
length of {string}). If {str} is shorter than {start} characters long, FALSE
will be returned.

If negative {length} is passed, |iconv_substr| cuts the portion out of {str}
from the {start}'th character up to the character that is {length} characters
away from the end of the string. In case {start} is also negative, the start
position is calculated beforehand according to the rule explained above.

Note that {offset} and {length} parameters are always deemed to represent
offsets that are calculated on the basis of the character set determined by
{charset}, whilst the counterpart |substr| always takes these for byte
offsets. If {charset} is not given, the character set is determined by the
iconv.internal_encoding ini setting.
