posix_getpwnam -- Return info about a user by username

  array posix_getpwnam(string username)~

Returns an associative array containing information about a user referenced by
an alphanumeric username, passed in the {username} parameter.

The array elements returned are: The user information array Element
Description name The name element contains the username of the user. This is
a short, usually less than 16 character "handle" of the user, not her real,
full name. This should be the same as the {username} parameter used when
calling the function, and hence redundant. passwd The passwd element contains
the user's password in an encrypted format. Often, for example on a system
employing "shadow" passwords, an asterisk is returned instead. uid User ID of
the user in numeric form. gid The group ID of the user. Use the function
|posix_getgrgid| to resolve the group name and a list of its members. gecos
GECOS is an obsolete term that refers to the finger information field on a
Honeywell batch processing system. The field, however, lives on, and its
contents have been formalized by POSIX. The field contains a comma separated
list containing the user's full name, office phone, office number, and home
phone number. On most systems, only the user's full name is available. dir
This element contains the absolute path to the home directory of the user.
shell The shell element contains the absolute path to the executable of the
user's default shell.
