ocicolumnprecision -- Tell the precision of a column

  int ocicolumnprecision(resource stmt, int col)~

Returns precision of the field with {col} index (1-based).

For FLOAT columns precision is nonzero and scale is -127. If precision is 0,
then columnt is NUMBER. Else it's NUMBER(precision, scale).

This function was renamed to |oci_field_precision| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For
downward compatibility |ocicolumnprecision| can also be used. This is
deprecated, however.
