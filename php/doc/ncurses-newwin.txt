ncurses_newwin -- Create a new window

  resource ncurses_newwin(int rows, int cols, int y, int x)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|ncurses_newwin| creates a new window to draw elements in. Windows can be
positioned using {x}, {y}, {rows} and {cols}. When creating additional
windows, remember to use |ncurses_getmaxyx| to check for available space, as
terminal size is individual and may vary. The return value is a resource ID
used to differ between multiple windows.
