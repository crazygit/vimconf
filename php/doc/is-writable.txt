is_writable -- Tells whether the filename is writable

  bool is_writable(string filename)~

Returns TRUE if the {filename} exists and is writable. The filename argument
may be a directory name allowing you to check if a directory is writeable.

Keep in mind that PHP may be accessing the file as the user id that the web
server runs as (often 'nobody'). Safe mode limitations are not taken into
account.

  $filename = 'test.txt';

  } else {
      echo 'The file is not writable';
  }
?>
