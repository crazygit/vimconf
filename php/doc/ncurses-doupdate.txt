  bool ncurses_doupdate()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|ncurses_doupdate| compares the virtual screen to the physical screen and
updates the physical screen. This way is more effective than using multiple
refresh calls. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
