ncurses_noraw -- Switch terminal out of raw mode

  bool ncurses_noraw()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|ncurses_noraw| switches the terminal out of raw mode. Raw mode is similar to
cbreak mode, in that characters typed are immediately passed through to the
user program. The differences that are that in raw mode, the interrupt, quit,
suspend and flow control characters are all passed through uninterpreted,
instead of generating a signal. Returns TRUE if any error occurred, otherwise
FALSE.
