xdiff_string_diff -- Make unified diff of two strings

  string xdiff_string_diff(string str1, string str2 [, int context [, bool minimal]])~

|xdiff_string_diff| makes unified diff of strings {str1} and {str2}. {context}
indicated how many lines of context you want to include in diff result. Set
{minimal} to TRUE if you want to minimalize size of diff (can take a long
time).

This function doesn't work well with binary strings. To make diff of binary
strings use |xdiff_string_diff_binary|.

Returns string with result or FALSE if an internal error happened.

|xdiff_string_diff| example The following code makes unified diff of two
articles.

<?php >
  $old_article = file_get_contents('./old_article.txt');
  $new_article = $_REQUEST['article']; /* Let's say that someone pasted a new article to html form */
  
  $diff = xdiff_string_diff($old_article, $new_article, 1);
  if (is_string($diff)) {
      echo "Differences between two articles:\n";
      echo $diff;
  }
?>
