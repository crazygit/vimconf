oci_num_rows -- Returns number of rows affected during statement execution

  int oci_num_rows(resource stmt)~

|oci_num_rows| returns number of rows affected during statement execution.

This function does not return number of rows selected! For SELECT statements
this function will return the number of rows, that were fetched to the buffer
with |oci_fetch*| functions.

|oci_num_rows| example

<?php >
      echo "<pre>";
      $conn = oci_connect("scott", "tiger");
       
      $stmt = oci_parse($conn, "create table emp2 as select * from emp");
      oci_execute($stmt);
      echo oci_num_rows($stmt) . " rows inserted.<br />";
      oci_free_statement($stmt);
      
      $stmt = oci_parse($conn, "delete from emp2");
      oci_execute($stmt, OCI_DEFAULT);
      echo oci_num_rows($stmt) . " rows deleted.<br />";
      oci_commit($conn);
      oci_free_statement($stmt);
      
      $stmt = oci_parse($conn, "drop table emp2");
      oci_execute($stmt);
      oci_free_statement($stmt);
      
      oci_close($conn);
      echo "</pre>";
?>

|oci_num_rows| returns FALSE on error.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocirowcount| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_num_rows| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
