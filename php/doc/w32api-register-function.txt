w32api_register_function -- Registers function function_name from library with
PHP

  bool w32api_register_function(string library, string function_name, string return_type)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

This function tries to find the {function_name} function in {libary}, and
tries to import it into PHP. The function will be registered with the given
{return_type}. This type can be a generic PHP type, or a type defined with
|w32api_deftype|. All type names are case sensitive. Built in type names
should be provided in lowercase. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
