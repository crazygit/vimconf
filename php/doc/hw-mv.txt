hw_mv -- Moves objects

  int hw_mv(int connection, array object_id_array, int source_id, int destination_id)~

Moves the objects with object ids as specified in the second parameter from
the collection with id {source_id} to the collection with the id
{destination_id}. If the destination id is 0 the objects will be unlinked
from the source collection. If this is the last instance of that object it
will be deleted. If you want to delete all instances at once, use
|hw_deleteobject|.

The value returned is the number of moved objects.

See also |hw_cp|, and |hw_deleteobject|.
