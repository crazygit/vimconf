hw_Connect -- Opens a connection

  int hw_connect(string host, int port [, string username, string password])~

Opens a connection to a Hyperwave server and returns a connection index on
success, or FALSE if the connection could not be made. Each of the arguments
should be a quoted string, except for the port number. The {username} and
{password} arguments are optional and can be left out. In such a case no
identification with the server will be done. It is similar to identify as
user anonymous. This function returns a connection index that is needed by
other Hyperwave functions. You can have multiple connections open at once.
Keep in mind, that the password is not encrypted.
