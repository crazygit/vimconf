is_readable -- Tells whether the filename is readable

  bool is_readable(string filename)~

Returns TRUE if the filename exists and is readable.

Keep in mind that PHP may be accessing the file as the user id that the web
server runs as (often 'nobody'). Safe mode limitations are not taken into
account.

|is_writable| example

<?php >
  $filename = 'test.txt';
  if (is_readable($filename)) {
      echo 'The file is readable';
  } else {
      echo 'The file is not readable';
  }
?>

As of PHP 5.0.0 this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.
