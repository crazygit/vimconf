ocilogoff -- Disconnects from Oracle server

  bool ocilogoff(resource connection)~

|ocilogoff| closes the Oracle connection {connection}.

Using |ocilogoff| isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution. See also freeing
resources.

This function was renamed to |oci_close| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For downward
compatibility |ocilogoff| can also be used. This is deprecated, however.
