imap_delete -- Mark a message for deletion from current mailbox

  bool imap_delete(int imap_stream, int msg_number [, int options])~

Returns TRUE.

|imap_delete| marks messages listed in {msg_number} for deletion. The optional
{flags} parameter only has a single option, {FT_UID}, which tells the function
to treat the {msg_number} argument as a {UID}. Messages marked for deletion
will stay in the mailbox until either |imap_expunge| is called or
|imap_close| is called with the optional parameter CL_EXPUNGE.

POP3 mailboxes do not have their message flags saved between connections, so
|imap_expunge| must be called during the same connection in order for
messages marked for deletion to actually be purged.

|imap_delete| example

<?php >
  $mbox = imap_open("{your.imap.host}INBOX", "username", "password")
      or die("Can't connect: " . imap_last_error());
  
  $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
  echo "Messages before delete: " . $check->Nmsgs . "<br />\n";
  
  imap_delete($mbox, 1);
  
  $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
  echo "Messages after  delete: " . $check->Nmsgs . "<br />\n";
  
  imap_expunge($mbox);
  
  $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
  echo "Messages after expunge: " . $check->Nmsgs . "<br />\n";
  
  imap_close($mbox);
?>
