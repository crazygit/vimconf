mt_rand -- Generate a better random value

  int mt_rand([int min, int max])~

Many random number generators of older libcs have dubious or unknown
characteristics and are slow. By default, PHP uses the libc random number
generator with the |rand| function. The |mt_rand| function is a drop-in
replacement for this. It uses a random number generator with known
characteristics using the Mersenne Twister, which will produce random numbers
four times faster than what the average libc rand() provides.

If called without the optional {min}, {max} arguments |mt_rand| returns a
pseudo-random value between 0 and RAND_MAX. If you want a random number
between 5 and 15 (inclusive), for example, use mt_rand (5, 15).

|mt_rand| example

<?php >
  echo mt_rand() . "\n";
  echo mt_rand() . "\n";
  
  echo mt_rand(5, 15);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  1604716014
  1478613278
  6

As of PHP 4.2.0, there is no need to seed the random number generator with
|srand| or |mt_srand| as this is now done automatically.

In versions before 3.0.7 the meaning of {max} was {range}. To get the same
results in these versions the short example should be mt_rand (5, 11) to get
a random number between 5 and 15.

See also: |mt_srand|, |mt_getrandmax|, and |rand|.
