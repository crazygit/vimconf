odbc_autocommit -- Toggle autocommit behaviour

  mixed odbc_autocommit(resource connection_id [, bool OnOff])~

Without the {OnOff} parameter, this function returns auto-commit status for
{connection_id}. Non-zero is returned if auto-commit is on, 0 if it is off,
or FALSE if an error occurs.

If {OnOff} is TRUE, auto-commit is enabled, if it is FALSE auto-commit is
disabled. Returns TRUE on success, FALSE on failure.

By default, auto-commit is on for a connection. Disabling auto-commit is
equivalent with starting a transaction.
