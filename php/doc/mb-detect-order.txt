mb_detect_order -- Set/Get character encoding detection order

  mixed mb_detect_order([mixed encoding_list])~

|mb_detect_order| sets automatic character encoding detection order to
{encoding_list}. It returns TRUE for success, FALSE for failure.

{encoding_list} is array or comma separated list of character encoding.
("auto" is expanded to "ASCII, JIS, UTF-8, EUC-JP, SJIS")

If {encoding_list} is omitted, it returns current character encoding detection
order as array.

This setting affects |mb_detect_encoding| and |mb_send_mail|.

mbstring currently implements following encoding detection filters. If there
is an invalid byte sequence for following encoding, encoding detection will
fail.

UTF-8, UTF-7, ASCII, EUC-JP,SJIS, eucJP-win, SJIS-win, JIS, ISO-2022-JP

For ISO-8859-*, mbstring always detects as ISO-8859-*.

For UTF-16, UTF-32, UCS2 and UCS4, encoding detection will fail always.

Useless detect order example

  ; Always detect as ISO-8859-1
  detect_order = ISO-8859-1, UTF-8
  
  ; Always detect as UTF-8, since ASCII/UTF-7 values are 
  ; valid for UTF-8
  detect_order = UTF-8, ASCII, UTF-7

|mb_detect_order| examples

<?php >
  /* Set detection order by enumerated list */
  mb_detect_order("eucjp-win,sjis-win,UTF-8");
  
  /* Set detection order by array */
  $ary[] = "ASCII";
  $ary[] = "JIS";
  $ary[] = "EUC-JP";
  mb_detect_order($ary);
  
  /* Display current detection order */
  echo implode(", ", mb_detect_order());
?>
