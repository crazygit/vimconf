rand -- Generate a random integer

  int rand([int min, int max])~

If called without the optional {min}, {max} arguments |rand| returns a
pseudo-random integer between 0 and RAND_MAX. If you want a random number
between 5 and 15 (inclusive), for example, use rand (5, 15).

|rand| example

<?php >
  echo rand() . "\n";
  echo rand() . "\n";
  
  echo rand(5, 15);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  7771
  22264
  11

On some platforms (such as Windows) RAND_MAX is only 32768. If you require a
range larger than 32768, specifying {min} and {max} will allow you to create
a range larger than RAND_MAX, or consider using |mt_rand| instead.

As of PHP 4.2.0, there is no need to seed the random number generator with
|srand| or |mt_srand| as this is now done automatically.

In versions before 3.0.7 the meaning of {max} was {range}. To get the same
results in these versions the short example should be rand (5, 11) to get a
random number between 5 and 15.

See also: |srand|, |getrandmax|, and |mt_rand|.
