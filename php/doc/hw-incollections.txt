hw_InCollections -- Check if object ids in collections

  array hw_incollections(int connection, array object_id_array, array collection_id_array, int return_collections)~

Checks whether a set of objects (documents or collections) specified by the
{object_id_array} is part of the collections listed in {collection_id_array}.
When the fourth parameter {return_collections} is 0, the subset of object ids
that is part of the collections (i.e., the documents or collections that are
children of one or more collections of collection ids or their
subcollections, recursively) is returned as an array. When the fourth
parameter is 1, however, the set of collections that have one or more objects
of this subset as children are returned as an array. This option allows a
client to, e.g., highlight the part of the collection hierarchy that contains
the matches of a previous query, in a graphical overview.
