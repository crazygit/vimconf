mssql_fetch_array -- Fetch a result row as an associative array, a numeric
array, or both

  array mssql_fetch_array(resource result [, int result_type])~

Returns: An array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are
no more rows.

|mssql_fetch_array| is an extended version of |mssql_fetch_row|. In addition
to storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also
stores the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.

An important thing to note is that using |mssql_fetch_array| is NOT
significantly slower than using |mssql_fetch_row|, while it provides a
significant added value.

Field names returned by this function are case-sensitive.

This function sets NULL fields to PHP NULL value.

For further details, also see |mssql_fetch_row|.
