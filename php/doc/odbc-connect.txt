odbc_connect -- Connect to a datasource

  resource odbc_connect(string dsn, string user, string password [, int cursor_type])~

Returns an ODBC connection id or 0 (FALSE) on error.

The connection id returned by this functions is needed by other ODBC
functions. You can have multiple connections open at once as long as they
either use different db or different credentials. The optional fourth
parameter sets the type of cursor to be used for this connection. This
parameter is not normally needed, but can be useful for working around
problems with some ODBC drivers.

With some ODBC drivers, executing a complex stored procedure may fail with an
error similar to: "Cannot open a cursor on a stored procedure that has
anything other than a single select statement in it". Using SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC
may avoid that error. Also, some drivers don't support the optional
row_number parameter in |odbc_fetch_row|. SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC might help in that
case, too.

The following constants are defined for cursortype:

SQL_CUR_USE_IF_NEEDED

SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC

SQL_CUR_USE_DRIVER

SQL_CUR_DEFAULT

For persistent connections see |odbc_pconnect|.
