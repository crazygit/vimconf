str_rot13 -- Perform the rot13 transform on a string

  string str_rot13(string str)~

This function performs the ROT13 encoding on the {str} argument and returns
the resulting string. The ROT13 encoding simply shifts every letter by 13
places in the alphabet while leaving non-alpha characters untouched. Encoding
and decoding are done by the same function, passing an encoded string as
argument will return the original version.

|str_rot13| example

<?php >
  echo str_rot13('PHP 4.3.0'); // CUC 4.3.0
?>

The behaviour of this function was buggy until PHP 4.3.0. Before this, the
{str} was also modified, as if passed by reference.
