imap_utf7_encode -- Converts ISO-8859-1 string to modified UTF-7 text

  string imap_utf7_encode(string data)~

Converts {data} to modified UTF-7 text. Note that {data} is expected to be
encoded in ISO-8859-1.

This is needed to encode mailbox names that contain certain characters which
are not in range of printable ASCII characters.

The modified UTF-7 encoding is defined in RFC 2060, section 5.1.3 (original
UTF-7 was defined in RFC1642).
