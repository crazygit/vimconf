sesam_affected_rows -- Get number of rows affected by an immediate query

  int sesam_affected_rows(string result_id)~

{result_id} is a valid result id returned by |sesam_query|.

Returns the number of rows affected by a query associated with {result_id}.

The |sesam_affected_rows| function can only return useful values when used in
combination with "immediate" SQL statements (updating operations like INSERT,
UPDATE and DELETE) because SESAM does not deliver any "affected rows"
information for "select type" queries. The number returned is the number of
affected rows.

|sesam_affected_rows| example

<?php >
  $result = sesam_execimm("DELETE FROM PHONE WHERE LASTNAME = '" . strtoupper($name) . "'");
  if (!$result) {
      /* ... error ... */
  }
  echo sesam_affected_rows($result).
      " entries with last name " . $name . " deleted.\n";
?>
