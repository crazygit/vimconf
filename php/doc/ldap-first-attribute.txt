ldap_first_attribute -- Return first attribute

  string ldap_first_attribute(resource link_identifier, resource result_entry_identifier, int ber_identifier)~

Returns the first attribute in the entry on success and FALSE on error.

Similar to reading entries, attributes are also read one by one from a
particular entry. |ldap_first_attribute| returns the first attribute in the
entry pointed by the {result_entry_identifier}. Remaining attributes are
retrieved by calling |ldap_next_attribute| successively. {ber_identifier} is
the identifier to internal memory location pointer. It is passed by
reference. The same {ber_identifier} is passed to the |ldap_next_attribute|
function, which modifies that pointer.
