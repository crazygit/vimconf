sem_get -- Get a semaphore id

  resource sem_get(int key [, int max_acquire [, int perm [, int auto_release]]])~

|sem_get| returns an id that can be used to access the System V semaphore with
the given {key}. The semaphore is created if necessary using the permission
bits specified in {perm} (defaults to 0666). The number of processes that can
acquire the semaphore simultaneously is set to {max_acquire} (defaults to 1).
Actually this value is set only if the process finds it is the only process
currently attached to the semaphore.

Optional parameter {auto_release} specifies if the semaphore should be
automatically released on request shutdown. It is available since PHP 4.3.0.

Returns a positive semaphore identifier on success, or FALSE on error.

A second call to |sem_get| for the same key will return a different semaphore
identifier, but both identifiers access the same underlying semaphore.

See also |sem_acquire|, |sem_release|, and |ftok|.
