This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|w32api_invoke_function| tries to find the previously registered function,
named {funcname}, passing the parameters you provided. The return type is the
one you set when you registered the function, the value is the one returned by
the function itself. Any of the arguments can be of any PHP type or
|w32api_deftype| defined type, as needed.
