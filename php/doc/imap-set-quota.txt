imap_set_quota -- Sets a quota for a given mailbox

  bool imap_set_quota(resource imap_stream, string quota_root, int quota_limit)~

Sets an upper limit quota on a per mailbox basis. This function requires the
{imap_stream} to have been opened as the mail administrator account. It will
not work if opened as any other user.

This function is currently only available to users of the c-client2000 or
greater library.

{imap_stream} is the stream pointer returned from a |imap_open| call. This
stream must be opened as the mail administrator, other wise this function
will fail. {quota_root} is the mailbox to have a quota set. This should
follow the IMAP standard format for a mailbox, 'user.name'. {quota_limit} is
the maximum size (in KB) for the {quota_root}.

Returns TRUE on success and FALSE on error.

|imap_set_quota| example

<?php >
  $mbox = imap_open("{your.imap.host:143}", "mailadmin", "password");
  
  if (!imap_set_quota($mbox, "user.kalowsky", 3000)) {
      echo "Error in setting quota\n";
      return;
  }
  
  imap_close($mbox);
?>
