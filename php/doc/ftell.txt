ftell -- Tells file pointer read/write position

  int ftell(resource handle)~

Returns the position of the file pointer referenced by {handle}; i.e., its
offset into the file stream.

If an error occurs, returns FALSE.

The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully opened
by |fopen| or |popen|. |ftell| gives undefined results for append-only
streams (opened with "a" flag).

|ftell| example

<?php >
  // opens a file and read some data
  $fp = fopen("/etc/passwd", "r");
  $data = fgets($fp, 12);
  
  // where are we ?
  echo ftell($fp); // 11
  
  fclose($fp);
?>

See also |fopen|, |popen|, |fseek|, and |rewind|.
