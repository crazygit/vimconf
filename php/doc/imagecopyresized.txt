imagecopyresized -- Copy and resize part of an image

  bool imagecopyresized(resource dst_image, resource src_image, int dst_x, int dst_y, int src_x, int src_y, int dst_w, int dst_h, int src_w, int src_h)~

|imagecopyresized| copies a rectangular portion of one image to another image.
{dst_image} is the destination image, {src_image} is the source image
identifier. If the source and destination coordinates and width and heights
differ, appropriate stretching or shrinking of the image fragment will be
performed. The coordinates refer to the upper left corner. This function can
be used to copy regions within the same image (if {dst_image} is the same as
{src_image}) but if the regions overlap the results will be unpredictable.

There is a problem due to palette image limitations (255+1 colors). Resampling
or filtering an image commonly needs more colors than 255, a kind of
approximation is used to calculate the new resampled pixel and its color.
With a palette image we try to allocate a new color, if that failed, we
choose the closest (in theory) computed color. This is not always the closest
visual color. That may produce a weird result, like blank (or visually blank)
images. To skip this problem, please use a truecolor image as a destination
image, such as one created by |imagecreatetruecolor|.

Resizing an image This example will display the image at half size.

<?php >
  // File and new size
  $filename = 'test.jpg';
  $percent = 0.5;
  
  // Content type
  header('Content-type: image/jpeg');
  
  // Get new sizes
  list($width, $height) = getimagesize($filename);
  $newwidth = $width * $percent;
  $newheight = $height * $percent;
  
  // Load
  $thumb = imagecreate($newwidth, $newheight);
  $source = imagecreatefromjpeg($filename);
  
  // Resize
  imagecopyresized($thumb, $source, 0, 0, 0, 0, $newwidth, $newheight, $width, $height);
  
  // Output
  imagejpeg($thumb);
?>

The image will be output at half size, though better quality could be obtained
using |imagecopyresampled|.
