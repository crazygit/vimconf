tempnam -- Create file with unique file name

  string tempnam(string dir, string prefix)~

Creates a file with a unique filename in the specified directory. If the
directory does not exist, |tempnam| may generate a file in the system's
temporary directory, and return the name of that.

Prior to PHP 4.0.6, the behaviour of the |tempnam| function was system
dependent. On Windows the TMP environment variable will override the {dir}
parameter, on Linux the TMPDIR environment variable has precedence, while
SVR4 will always use your {dir} parameter if the directory it points to
exists. Consult your system documentation on the tempnam(3) function if in
doubt.

If PHP cannot create a file in the specified {dir} parameter, it falls back on
the system default.

Returns the new temporary filename, or FALSE on failure. |tempnam| example

<?php >
  $tmpfname = tempnam("/tmp", "FOO");
  
  $handle = fopen($tmpfname, "w");
  fwrite($handle, "writing to tempfile");
  fclose($handle);
  
  // do here something
  
  unlink($tmpfname);
?>

This function's behavior changed in 4.0.3. The temporary file is also created
to avoid a race condition where the file might appear in the filesystem
between the time the string was generated and before the script gets around
to creating the file. Note, that you need to remove the file in case you need
it no more, it is not done automatically.

See also |tmpfile| and |unlink|.
