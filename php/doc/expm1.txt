expm1 -- Returns exp(number) - 1, computed in a way that is accurate even when
the value of number is close to zero

  float expm1(float number)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|expm1| returns the equivalent to 'exp({number}) - 1' computed in a way that
is accurate even if the value of {number} is near zero, a case where 'exp
({number}) - 1' would be inaccurate due to subtraction of two numbers that
are nearly equal.

This function is not implemented on Windows platforms.

See also |log1p| and |exp|.
