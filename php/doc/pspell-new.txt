pspell_new -- Load a new dictionary

  int pspell_new(string language [, string spelling [, string jargon [, string encoding [, int mode]]]])~

|pspell_new| opens up a new dictionary and returns the dictionary link
identifier for use in other pspell functions.

The language parameter is the language code which consists of the two letter
ISO 639 language code and an optional two letter ISO 3166 country code after
a dash or underscore.

The spelling parameter is the requested spelling for languages with more than
one spelling such as English. Known values are 'american', 'british', and
'canadian'.

The jargon parameter contains extra information to distinguish two different
words lists that have the same language and spelling parameters.

The encoding parameter is the encoding that words are expected to be in. Valid
values are 'utf-8', 'iso8859-*', 'koi8-r', 'viscii', 'cp1252', 'machine
unsigned 16', 'machine unsigned 32'. This parameter is largely untested, so
be careful when using.

The mode parameter is the mode in which spellchecker will work. There are
several modes available: PSPELL_FAST - Fast mode (least number of
suggestions)

PSPELL_NORMAL - Normal mode (more suggestions)

PSPELL_BAD_SPELLERS - Slow mode (a lot of suggestions)

PSPELL_RUN_TOGETHER - Consider run-together words as legal compounds. That is,
"thecat" will be a legal compound, although there should be a space between
the two words. Changing this setting only affects the results returned by
|pspell_check|; |pspell_suggest| will still return suggestions.

Mode is a bitmask constructed from different constants listed above. However,
PSPELL_FAST, PSPELL_NORMAL and PSPELL_BAD_SPELLERS are mutually exclusive, so
you should select only one of them.
