imap_body -- Read the message body

  string imap_body(resource imap_stream, int msg_number [, int options])~

|imap_body| returns the body of the message, numbered {msg_number} in the
current mailbox.

The optional {options} are a bit mask with one or more of the following:
FT_UID - The {msg_number} is a UID

FT_PEEK - Do not set the \Seen flag if not already set

FT_INTERNAL - The return string is in internal format, will not canonicalize
to CRLF.

|imap_body| will only return a verbatim copy of the message body. To extract
single parts of a multipart MIME-encoded message you have to use
|imap_fetchstructure| to analyze its structure and |imap_fetchbody| to
extract a copy of a single body component.
