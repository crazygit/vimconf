xml_set_character_data_handler -- Set up character data handler

  bool xml_set_character_data_handler(resource parser, callback handler)~

Sets the character data handler function for the XML parser {parser}.
{handler} is a string containing the name of a function that must exist when
|xml_parse| is called for {parser}.

  bool (resource parser, callback handler, resource parser, string data)~

The function named by {handler} must accept two parameters: {parser} The first
parameter, parser, is a reference to the XML parser calling the handler.

{data} The second parameter, {data}, contains the character data as a string.

If a handler function is set to an empty string, or FALSE, the handler in
question is disabled.

TRUE is returned if the handler is set up, FALSE if {parser} is not a parser.

Instead of a function name, an array containing an object reference and a
method name can also be supplied.
