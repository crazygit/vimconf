mssql_query -- Send MS SQL query

  mixed mssql_query(string query [, resource link_identifier [, int batch_size]])~

Returns: A MS SQL result resource on success, TRUE if no rows were returned,
or FALSE on error.

|mssql_query| sends a query to the currently active database on the server
that's associated with the specified link identifier. If the link identifier
isn't specified, the last opened link is assumed. If no link is open, the
function tries to establish a link as if |mssql_connect| was called, and use
it.

See also |mssql_select_db| and |mssql_connect|.
