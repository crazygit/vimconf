mb_strcut -- Get part of string

  string mb_strcut(string str, int start [, int length [, string encoding]])~

|mb_strcut| returns the portion of {str} specified by the {start} and {length}
parameters.

|mb_strcut| performs equivalent operation as |mb_substr| with different
method. If {start} position is multi-byte character's second byte or larger,
it starts from first byte of multi-byte character.

It subtracts string from {str} that is shorter than {length} AND character
that is not part of multi-byte string or not being middle of shift sequence.

{encoding} is character encoding. If it is not set, internal character
encoding is used.

See also |mb_substr|, |mb_internal_encoding|.
