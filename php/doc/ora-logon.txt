ora_logon -- Open an Oracle connection

  resource ora_logon(string user, string password)~

Establishes a connection between PHP and an Oracle database with the given
username {user} and password {password}.

Connections can be made using SQL*Net by supplying the TNS name to {user} like
this:

<?php >
  $conn = Ora_Logon("user@TNSNAME", "pass");
?>

If you have character data with non-ASCII characters, you should make sure
that NLS_LANG is set in your environment. For server modules, you should set
it in the server's environment before starting the server.

Returns a connection index on success, or FALSE on failure. Details about the
error can be retrieved using the |ora_error| and |ora_errorcode| functions.
