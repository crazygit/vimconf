fread -- Binary-safe file read

  string fread(resource handle, int length)~

|fread| reads up to {length} bytes from the file pointer referenced by
{handle}. Reading stops when {length} bytes have been read, EOF (end of file)
is reached, or (for network streams) when a packet becomes available,
whichever comes first.

<?php >
  // get contents of a file into a string
  $filename = "/usr/local/something.txt";
  $handle = fopen($filename, "r");
  $contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
  fclose($handle);
?>

On systems which differentiate between binary and text files (i.e. Windows)
the file must be opened with 'b' included in |fopen| mode parameter.

<?php >
  $filename = "c:\\files\\somepic.gif";
  $handle = fopen($filename, "rb");
  $contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
  fclose($handle);
?>

When reading from network streams or pipes, such as those returned when
reading remote files or from |popen| and |fsockopen|, reading will stop after
a packet is available. This means that you should collect the data together in
chunks as shown in the example below.

<?php >
  $handle = fopen("http://www.example.com/", "rb");
  $contents = '';
  while (!feof($handle)) {
    $contents .= fread($handle, 8192);
  }
  fclose($handle);
?>

If you just want to get the contents of a file into a string, use
|file_get_contents| as it has much better performance than the code above.

See also |fwrite|, |fopen|, |fsockopen|, |popen|, |fgets|, |fgetss|, |fscanf|,
|file|, and |fpassthru|.
