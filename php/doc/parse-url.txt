parse_url -- Parse a URL and return its components

  array parse_url(string url)~

This function returns an associative array containing any of the various
components of the URL that are present. If one of them is missing, no entry
will be created for it. The components are : scheme - e.g. http

host

port

user

pass

path

query - after the question mark ?

fragment - after the hashmark #

This function is not meant to validate the given URL, it only breaks it up
into the above listed parts. Partial URLs are also accepted, |parse_url|
tries its best to parse them correctly.

This function doesn't work with relative URLs.
