fputcsv -- Format line as CSV and write to file pointer

  int fputcsv(resource handle [, array fields [, string delimiter [, string enclosure]]])~

|fputcsv| formats a line (passed as a {fields} array) as CSV and write it to
the specified file {handle}. Returns the length of the written string, or
FALSE on failure.

The optional {delimiter} parameter sets the field delimiter (one character
only). Defaults as a comma: ,.

The optional {enclosure} parameter sets the field enclosure (one character
only) and defaults to a double quotation mark: ".

|fputcsv| example

<?php >
  $list = array (
      'aaa,bbb,ccc,dddd',
      '123,456,789',
      '"aaa","bbb"'
  );
  
  $fp = fopen('file.csv', 'w');
  
  foreach ($list as $line) {
      fputcsv($fp, split(',', $line));
  }
  
  fclose($fp);
?>

If you are having problems with PHP not recognizing the line endings when
reading files either on or created by a Macintosh computer, you might want to
enable the auto_detect_line_endings run-time configuration option.
