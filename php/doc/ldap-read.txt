ldap_read -- Read an entry

  resource ldap_read(resource link_identifier, string base_dn, string filter [, array attributes [, int attrsonly [, int sizelimit [, int timelimit [, int deref]]]]])~

Returns a search result identifier or FALSE on error.

|ldap_read| performs the search for a specified {filter} on the directory with
the scope LDAP_SCOPE_BASE. So it is equivalent to reading an entry from the
directory.

An empty filter is not allowed. If you want to retrieve absolutely all
information for this entry, use a filter of "objectClass=*". If you know
which entry types are used on the directory server, you might use an
appropriate filter such as "objectClass=inetOrgPerson".

This call takes 5 optional parameters. See |ldap_search| notes.

These optional parameters were added in 4.0.2: {attrsonly}, {sizelimit},
{timelimit}, {deref}.

From 4.0.5 on it's also possible to do parallel searches. See |ldap_search|
for details.
