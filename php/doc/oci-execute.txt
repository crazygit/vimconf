oci_execute -- Executes a statement

  bool oci_execute(resource stmt [, int mode])~

|oci_execute| executes a previously parsed statement (see |oci_parse|). The
optional {mode} allows you to specify the execution mode (default is
OCI_COMMIT_ON_SUCCESS). If you don't want statements to be committed
automatically, you should specify OCI_DEFAULT as your {mode}.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ociexecute| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_execute| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
