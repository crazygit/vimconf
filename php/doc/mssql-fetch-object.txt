mssql_fetch_object -- Fetch row as object

  object mssql_fetch_object(resource result)~

Returns: An object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or
FALSE if there are no more rows.

|mssql_fetch_object| is similar to |mssql_fetch_array|, with one difference -
an object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you
can only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets
(numbers are illegal property names).

Field names returned by this function are case-sensitive.

This function sets NULL fields to PHP NULL value.

Speed-wise, the function is identical to |mssql_fetch_array|, and almost as
quick as |mssql_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).

See also |mssql_fetch_array|, and |mssql_fetch_row|.
