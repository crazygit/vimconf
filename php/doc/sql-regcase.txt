sql_regcase -- Make regular expression for case insensitive match

  string sql_regcase(string string)~

Returns a valid regular expression which will match {string}, ignoring case.
This expression is {string} with each alphabetic character converted to a
bracket expression; this bracket expression contains that character's
uppercase and lowercase form. Other characters remain unchanged.

|sql_regcase| example

<?php >
  echo sql_regcase("Foo - bar.");
?>

The above example will output:

  [Ff][Oo][Oo] - [Bb][Aa][Rr].

This can be used to achieve case insensitive pattern matching in products
which support only case sensitive regular expressions.
