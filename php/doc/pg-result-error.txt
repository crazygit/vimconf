pg_result_error -- Get error message associated with result

  string pg_result_error(resource result)~

|pg_result_error| returns any error message associated with the {result}
resource. Therefore, the user has a better chance of getting the correct
error message than with |pg_last_error|.

The function |pg_result_error_field| can give much greater detail on result
errors than |pg_result_error|.

Because |pg_query| returns FALSE if the query fails, you must use
|pg_send_query| and |pg_get_result| to get the result handle.

{result} PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by |pg_query|,
|pg_query_params| or |pg_execute| (among others).

{offset} Row to move the internal offset to in the {result} resource. Rows are
numbered starting from zero.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|pg_result_seek| example

<?php >
  // Connect to the database
  $conn = pg_pconnect("dbname=publisher");
  
  // Execute a query
  $result = pg_query($conn, "SELECT author, email FROM authors");
  
  // Seek to the 3rd row (assuming there are 3 rows)
  pg_result_seek($result, 2);
  
  // Fetch the 3rd row
  $row = pg_fetch_row($result);
?>
