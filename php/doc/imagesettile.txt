imagesettile -- Set the tile image for filling

  bool imagesettile(resource image, resource tile)~

|imagesettile| sets the tile image to be used by all region filling functions
(such as |imagefill| and |imagefilledpolygon|) when filling with the special
color IMG_COLOR_TILED.

A tile is an image used to fill an area with a repeated pattern. Any GD image
can be used as a tile, and by setting the transparent color index of the tile
image with |imagecolortransparent|, a tile allows certain parts of the
underlying area to shine through can be created.

You need not take special action when you are finished with a tile, but if you
destroy the tile image, you must not use the IMG_COLOR_TILED color until you
have set a new tile image!
