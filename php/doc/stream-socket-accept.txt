stream_socket_accept -- Accept a connection on a socket created by
stream_socket_server

  resource stream_socket_accept(resource server_socket [, float timeout [, string peername]])~

Accept a connection on a socket previously created by |stream_socket_server|.
If {timeout} is specified, the default socket accept timeout will be
overridden with the time specified in seconds. The name (address) of the
client which connected will be passed back in {peername} if included and
available from the selected transport.

{peername} can also be determined later using |stream_socket_get_name|.

If the call fails, it will return FALSE.

This function should not be used with UDP server sockets. Instead, use
|stream_socket_recvfrom| and |stream_socket_sendto|.

See also |stream_socket_server|, |stream_socket_get_name|,
|stream_set_blocking|, |stream_set_timeout|, |fgets|, |fgetss|, |fwrite|,
|fclose|, |feof|, and the Curl extension.
