snmpwalkoid -- Query for a tree of information about a network entity

  array snmpwalkoid(string hostname, string community, string object_id [, int timeout [, int retries]])~

Returns an associative array with object ids and their respective object value
starting from the {object_id} as root and FALSE on error.

|snmpwalkoid| function is used to read all object ids and their respective
values from an SNMP agent specified by the {hostname}. Community specifies
the read {community} for that agent. A NULL {object_id} is taken as the root
of the SNMP objects tree and all objects under that tree are returned as an
array. If {object_id} is specified, all the SNMP objects below that
{object_id} are returned.

The existence of |snmpwalkoid| and |snmpwalk| has historical reasons. Both
functions are provided for backward compatibility.

<?php >
  $a = snmpwalkoid("127.0.0.1", "public", ""); 
?>

Above function call would return all the SNMP objects from the SNMP agent
running on localhost. One can step through the values with a loop

<?php >
  for (reset($a); $i = key($a); next($a)) {
      echo "$i: $a[$i]<br />\n";
  }
?>
