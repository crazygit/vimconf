posix_getsid -- Get the current sid of the process

  int posix_getsid(int pid)~

Return the sid of the process {pid}. If {pid} is 0, the sid of the current
process is returned.

This is not a POSIX function, but is common on System V systems. If your
system does not support this function at system level, this PHP function will
always return FALSE.
