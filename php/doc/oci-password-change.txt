oci_password_change -- Changes password of Oracle's user

  bool oci_password_change(resource connection, string username, string old_password, string new_password)~

Changes password for user with {username}. Parameters {old_password} and
{new_password} should indicate old and new passwords respectively.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocipasswordchange| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_password_change| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
