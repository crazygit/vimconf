  bool mb_send_mail(string to, string subject, string message [, string additional_headers [, string additional_parameter]])~

|mb_send_mail| sends email. Headers and message are converted and encoded
according to |mb_language| setting. |mb_send_mail| is wrapper function of
|mail|. See |mail| for details.

{to} is mail addresses send to. Multiple recipients can be specified by
putting a comma between each address in to. This parameter is not
automatically encoded.
