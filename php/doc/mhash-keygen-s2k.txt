mhash_keygen_s2k -- Generates a key

  string mhash_keygen_s2k(int hash, string password, string salt, int bytes)~

|mhash_keygen_s2k| generates a key that is {bytes} long, from a user given
password. This is the Salted S2K algorithm as specified in the OpenPGP
document (RFC 2440). That algorithm will use the specified {hash} algorithm
to create the key. The {salt} must be different and random enough for every
key you generate in order to create different keys. That salt must be known
when you check the keys, thus it is a good idea to append the key to it. Salt
has a fixed length of 8 bytes and will be padded with zeros if you supply less
bytes.

Keep in mind that user supplied passwords are not really suitable to be used
as keys in cryptographic algorithms, since users normally choose keys they
can write on keyboard. These passwords use only 6 to 7 bits per character (or
less). It is highly recommended to use some kind of transformation (like this
function) to the user supplied key.
