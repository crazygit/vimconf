swf_startbutton -- Start the definition of a button

  void swf_startbutton(int objid, int type)~

The |swf_startbutton| function starts off the definition of a button. The
{type} parameter can either be TYPE_MENUBUTTON or TYPE_PUSHBUTTON. The
TYPE_MENUBUTTON constant allows the focus to travel from the button when the
mouse is down, TYPE_PUSHBUTTON does not allow the focus to travel when the
mouse is down.
