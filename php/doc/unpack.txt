unpack -- Unpack data from binary string

  array unpack(string format, string data)~

|unpack| from binary string into array according to {format}. Returns array
containing unpacked elements of binary string.

|unpack| works slightly different from Perl as the unpacked data is stored in
an associative array. To accomplish this you have to name the different
format codes and separate them by a slash /. |unpack| example

<?php >
  $array = unpack("c2chars/nint", $binarydata);
?>

The resulting array will contain the entries "chars1", "chars2" and "int".

Note that PHP internally stores integral values as signed. If you unpack a
large unsigned long and it is of the same size as PHP internally stored
values the result will be a negative number even though unsigned unpacking
was specified.

See also |pack| for an explanation of the format codes.
