in_array -- Checks if a value exists in an array

  bool in_array(mixed needle, array haystack [, bool strict])~

Searches {haystack} for {needle} and returns TRUE if it is found in the array,
FALSE otherwise.

If the third parameter {strict} is set to TRUE then the |in_array| function
will also check the types of the {needle} in the {haystack}.

If {needle} is a string, the comparison is done in a case-sensitive manner.

In PHP versions before 4.2.0 {needle} was not allowed to be an array.

|in_array| example

<?php >
  $os = array("Mac", "NT", "Irix", "Linux");
  if (in_array("Irix", $os)) {
      echo "Got Irix";
  }
  if (in_array("mac", $os)) {
      echo "Got mac";
  }
?>

The second condition fails because |in_array| is case-sensitive, so the
program above will display:

  Got Irix

|in_array| with strict example

<?php >
  $a = array('1.10', 12.4, 1.13);
  
  if (in_array('12.4', $a, true)) {
      echo "'12.4' found with strict check\n";
  }
  
  if (in_array(1.13, $a, true)) {
      echo "1.13 found with strict check\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  1.13 found with strict check

|in_array| with an array as needle

<?php >
  $a = array(array('p', 'h'), array('p', 'r'), 'o');
  
  if (in_array(array('p', 'h'), $a)) {
      echo "'ph' was found\n";
  }
  
  if (in_array(array('f', 'i'), $a)) {
      echo "'fi' was found\n";
  }
  
  if (in_array('o', $a)) {
      echo "'o' was found\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  'ph' was found
    'o' was found
