link -- Create a hard link

  bool link(string target, string link)~

|link| creates a hard link. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

This function will not work on remote files as the file to be examined must be
accessible via the servers filesystem.

This function is not implemented on Windows platforms.

See also the |symlink| to create soft links, and |readlink| along with
|linkinfo|.
