ibase_blob_get -- Get len bytes data from open blob

  string ibase_blob_get(resource blob_handle, int len)~

This function returns at most {len} bytes from a BLOB that has been opened for
reading by |ibase_blob_open|. Returns FALSE on failure.

<?php >
      $sql       = "SELECT blob_value FROM table";
      $result    = ibase_query($sql);
      $data      = ibase_fetch_object($result);
      $blob_data = ibase_blob_info($data->BLOB_VALUE);
      $blob_hndl = ibase_blob_open($data->BLOB_VALUE);
      echo         ibase_blob_get($blob_hndl, $blob_data[0]);
?>

Whilst this example doesn't do much more than a
'ibase_blob_echo($data->BLOB_VALUE)' would do, it does show you how to get
information into a $variable to manipulate as you please.

It is not possible to read from a BLOB that has been opened for writing by
|ibase_blob_create|.

See also |ibase_blob_open|, |ibase_blob_close| and |ibase_blob_echo|.
