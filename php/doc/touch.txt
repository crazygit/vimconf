touch -- Sets access and modification time of file

  bool touch(string filename [, int time [, int atime]])~

Attempts to set the access and modification time of the file named by
{filename} to the value given by {time}. If the parameter {time} is not
given, uses the present time. This is equivalent to what utime (sometimes
referred to as utimes) does. If the third parameter {atime} is present, the
access time of the given filename is set to the value of {atime}. Note that
the access time is always modified, regardless of the number of parameters.

If the file does not exist, it is created. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on
failure.

|touch| example

<?php >
  if (touch($FileName)) {
      echo "$FileName modification time has been changed to present time";
  
  } else {
      echo "Sorry, could not change modification time of $FileName";
  
  }
?>
