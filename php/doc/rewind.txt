rewind -- Rewind the position of a file pointer

  bool rewind(resource handle)~

Sets the file position indicator for {handle} to the beginning of the file
stream.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully opened
by |fopen|.

If you have opened the file in append ("a" or "a+") mode, any data you write
to the file will always be appended, regardless of the file position.

See also |fseek| and |ftell|.
