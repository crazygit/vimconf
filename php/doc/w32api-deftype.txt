  bool w32api_deftype(string typename, string member1_type, string member1_name [, string ... [, string ...]])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

If you would like to define a type for a w32api call, you need to call
|w32api_deftype|. This function takes 2n+1 arguments, where n is the number
of members the type has. The first argument is the name of the type. After
that is the type of the member followed by the members name (in pairs). A
member type can be a user defined type. All the type names are case
sensitive. Built in type names should be provided in lowercase. Returns TRUE
on success or FALSE on failure.
