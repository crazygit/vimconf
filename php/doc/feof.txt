feof -- Tests for end-of-file on a file pointer

  bool feof(resource handle)~

Returns TRUE if the file pointer is at EOF or an error occurs (including
socket timeout); otherwise returns FALSE.

If a connection opened by |fsockopen| wasn't closed by the server, |feof| will
wait until a timeout has been reached to return TRUE. The default timeout
value is 60 seconds. You may use |stream_set_timeout| to change this value.

The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully opened
by |fopen| or |fsockopen|.
