SWFMovie->setbackground -- Sets the background color

  void swfmovie->setbackground(int red, int green, int blue)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfmovie->setbackground| sets the background color. Why is there no rgba
version? Think about it. (Actually, that's not such a dumb question after
all- you might want to let the HTML background show through. There's a way to
do that, but it only works on IE4. Search the http://www.macromedia.com/ site
for details.)
