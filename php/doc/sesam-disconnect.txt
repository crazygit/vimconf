sesam_disconnect -- Detach from SESAM connection

  bool sesam_disconnect()~

Returns: always TRUE.

|sesam_disconnect| closes the logical link to a SESAM database (without
actually disconnecting and unloading the driver).

Note that this isn't usually necessary, as the open connection is
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution. Uncommitted data
will be discarded, because an implicit |sesam_rollback| is executed.

|sesam_disconnect| will not close the persistent link, it will only invalidate
the currently defined {"catalog"}, {"schema"} and {"user"} triple, so that any
sesam function called after |sesam_disconnect| will fail.

Closing a SESAM connection

<?php >
  if (sesam_connect ("mycatalog", "myschema", "otto")) {
      /* ... some queries and stuff ... */
      sesam_disconnect(); 
  }
?>
