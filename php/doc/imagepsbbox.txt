imagepsbbox -- Give the bounding box of a text rectangle using PostScript
Type1 fonts

  array imagepsbbox(string text, int font, int size [, int space, int tightness, float angle])~

{size} is expressed in pixels.

{space} allows you to change the default value of a space in a font. This
amount is added to the normal value and can also be negative.

{tightness} allows you to control the amount of white space between
characters. This amount is added to the normal character width and can also
be negative.

{angle} is in degrees.

Parameters {space} and {tightness} are expressed in character space units,
where 1 unit is 1/1000th of an em-square.

Parameters {space}, {tightness}, and {angle} are optional.

The bounding box is calculated using information available from character
metrics, and unfortunately tends to differ slightly from the results achieved
by actually rasterizing the text. If the angle is 0 degrees, you can expect
the text to need 1 pixel more to every direction.

This function is only available if PHP is compiled using --with-t1lib[=DIR].

This function returns an array containing the following elements: 0 lower left
x-coordinate 1 lower left y-coordinate 2 upper right x-coordinate 3 upper
right y-coordinate
