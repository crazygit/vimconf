getmxrr -- Get MX records corresponding to a given Internet host name

  bool getmxrr(string hostname, array mxhosts [, array weight])~

Searches DNS for MX records corresponding to {hostname}. Returns TRUE if any
records are found; returns FALSE if no records were found or if an error
occurred.

A list of the MX records found is placed into the array {mxhosts}. If the
{weight} array is given, it will be filled with the weight information
gathered.

This function should not be used for the purposes of address verification.
Only the mailexchangers found in DNS are returned, however, according to RFC
2821 when no mail exchangers are listed, {hostname} itself should be used as
the only mail exchanger with a priority of 0.

This function is not implemented on Windows platforms. Try the PEAR class
Net_DNS.
