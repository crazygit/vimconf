ocisetprefetch -- Sets number of rows to be prefetched

  bool ocisetprefetch(resource stmt, int rows)~

Sets the number of top level rows to be prefetched to {rows}. The default
value for {rows} is 1 row.

This function was renamed to |oci_set_prefetch| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For
downward compatibility |ocisetprefetch| can also be used. This is deprecated,
however.
