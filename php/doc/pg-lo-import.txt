pg_lo_import -- Import a large object from file

  int pg_lo_import(resource connection, string pathname)~

  int pg_lo_import(resource connection, string pathname, string pathname)~

In versions before PHP 4.2.0 the syntax of this function was different, see
the following definition:

  int pg_lo_import(resource connection, string pathname, string pathname, string pathname [, resource connection])~

|pg_lo_import| creates a new large object in the database using a file on the
filesystem as its data source.

To use the large object interface, it is necessary to enclose it within a
transaction block.

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories you are
about to operate on have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being
executed.

This function used to be called |pg_loimport|.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

{pathname} The full path and file name of the file on the client filesystem
from which to read the large object data.

The OID of the newly created large object, or FALSE on failure.
