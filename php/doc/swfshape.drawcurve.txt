SWFShape->drawCurve -- Draws a curve (relative)

  int swfshape->drawcurve(int controldx, int controldy, int anchordx, int anchordy [, int targetdx, int targetdy])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfshape->drawcurve| draws a quadratic curve (using the current line
style,set by |swfshape->setline|) from the current pen position to the
relative position ({anchorx},{anchory}) using relative control point
({controlx},{controly}). That is, head towards the control point, then
smoothly turn to the anchor point.

With 6 parameters, it draws a cubic bezier to point (x+{targetdx},
x+{targetdy}) with control points (x+{controldx}, y+{controldy}) and
(x+{anchordx}, y+{anchordy}).

See also |swfshape->drawlineto|, |swfshape->drawline|, |swfshape->movepento|
and |swfshape->movepen|.
