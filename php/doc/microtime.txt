microtime -- Return current Unix timestamp with microseconds

  mixed microtime([bool get_as_float])~

|microtime| returns the current Unix timestamp with microseconds. This
function is only available on operating systems that support the
gettimeofday() system call.

When called without the optional argument, this function returns the string
"msec sec" where sec is the current time measured in the number of seconds
since the Unix Epoch (0:00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT), and msec is the
microseconds part. Both portions of the string are returned in units of
seconds.

When {get_as_float} is given, and evaluates to TRUE, |microtime| will return a
float.

The {get_as_float} parameter was added as of PHP 5.0.0.

Timing script execution with |microtime|

<?php >
  /**
   * Simple function to replicate PHP 5 behaviour
   */
  function microtime_float()
  {
      list($usec, $sec) = explode(" ", microtime());
      return ((float)$usec + (float)$sec);
  }
  
  $time_start = microtime_float();
  
  // Sleep for a while
  usleep(100);
  
  $time_end = microtime_float();
  $time = $time_end - $time_start;
  
  echo "Did nothing in $time seconds\n";
?>

Timing script execution in PHP 5

<?php >
  $time_start = microtime(true);
  
  // Sleep for a while
  usleep(100);
  
  $time_end = microtime(true);
  $time = $time_end - $time_start;
  
  echo "Did nothing in $time seconds\n";
?>
