iconv -- Convert string to requested character encoding

  string iconv(string in_charset, string out_charset, string str)~

Performs a character set conversion on the string {str} from {in_charset} to
{out_charset}. Returns the converted string or FALSE on failure.

If you append the string //TRANSLIT to {out_charset} transliteration is
activated. This means that when a character can't be represented in the
target charset, it can be approximated through one or several similarly
looking characters. If you append the string //IGNORE, characters that cannot
be represented in the target charset are silently discarded. Otherwise, {str}
is cut from the first illegal character.

|iconv| example:

<?php >
  echo iconv("ISO-8859-1", "UTF-8", "This is a test.");
?>
