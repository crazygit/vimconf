lob->setBuffering -- Changes current state of buffering for large object

  bool lob->setBuffering(bool on_off)~

|lob->setBuffering| sets the buffering for the large object, depending on the
value of the {on_off} parameter. Repeated calls to |lob->setBuffering| with
the same flag will return TRUE. The values for {on_off } are: TRUE for on and
FALSE for off.

Use of this function may provide performance improvements by buffering small
reads and writes of LOBs by reducing the number of network round-trips and
LOB versions. |oci_lob_flush| should be used to flush buffers, when you have
finished working with the large object.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
