readfile -- Outputs a file

  int readfile(string filename [, bool use_include_path [, resource context]])~

Reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.

Returns the number of bytes read from the file. If an error occurs, FALSE is
returned and unless the function was called as @|readfile|, an error message
is printed.

You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename and
for a list of supported URL protocols.

You can use the optional second parameter and set it to TRUE, if you want to
search for the file in the include_path, too.

Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of contexts, refer
to .
