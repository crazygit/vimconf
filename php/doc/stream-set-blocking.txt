stream_set_blocking -- Set blocking/non-blocking mode on a stream

  bool stream_set_blocking(resource stream, int mode)~

If {mode} is 0, the given stream will be switched to non-blocking mode, and if
1, it will be switched to blocking mode. This affects calls like |fgets| and
|fread| that read from the stream. In non-blocking mode an |fgets| call will
always return right away while in blocking mode it will wait for data to
become available on the stream.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

This function was previously called as |set_socket_blocking| and later
|socket_set_blocking| but this usage is deprecated.

Prior to PHP 4.3, this function only worked on socket based streams. Since PHP
4.3, this function works for any stream that supports non-blocking mode
(currently, regular files and socket streams).

See also |stream_select|.
