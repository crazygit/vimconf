fam_monitor_collection -- Monitor a collection of files in a directory for
changes

  resource fam_monitor_collection(resource fam, string dirname, int depth, string mask)~

|fam_monitor_collection| requests monitoring for a collection of files within
a directory. The actual files to be monitored are specified by a directory
path in {dirname}, the maximum search {depth} starting from this directory
and a shell pattern {mask} restricting the file names to look for.

A FAM event will be generated whenever the status of the files change. The
possible event codes are described in detail in the constants part of this
section.
