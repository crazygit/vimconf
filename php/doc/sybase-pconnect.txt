sybase_pconnect -- Open persistent Sybase connection

  resource sybase_pconnect([string servername [, string username [, string password [, string charset [, string appname]]]]])~

Returns a positive Sybase persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on
error.

|sybase_pconnect| acts very much like |sybase_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(|sybase_close| will not close links established by |sybase_pconnect|).

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.

See also |sybase_connect|.
