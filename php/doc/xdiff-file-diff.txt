xdiff_file_diff -- Make unified diff of two files

  bool xdiff_file_diff(string file1, string file2, string dest [, int context [, bool minimal]])~

|xdiff_file_diff| makes unified diff of files {file1} and {file2} and stores
result in file {dest}. {context} indicated how many lines of context you want
to include in diff result. Set {minimal} to TRUE if you want to minimalize
size of diff (can take a long time). Resulting file is human-readable.

This function doesn't work well with binary files. To make diff of binary
files use |xdiff_file_diff_binary|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|xdiff_file_diff| example The following code makes unified diff of two php
files.

<?php >
  $old_version = 'my_script.php';
  $new_version = 'my_new_script.php';
  
  xdiff_file_diff($old_version, $new_version, 'my_script.diff', 2);
?>
