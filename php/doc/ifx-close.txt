ifx_close -- Close Informix connection

  int ifx_close([int link_identifier])~

Returns: always TRUE.

|ifx_close| closes the link to an Informix database that's associated with the
specified link identifier. If the link identifier isn't specified, the last
opened link is assumed.

Note that this isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution.

|ifx_close| will not close persistent links generated by |ifx_pconnect|.
