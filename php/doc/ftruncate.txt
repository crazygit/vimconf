ftruncate -- Truncates a file to a given length

  bool ftruncate(resource handle, int size)~

Takes the filepointer, {handle}, and truncates the file to length, {size}.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

The file pointer is changed only in append mode. In write mode, additional
|fseek| call is needed.

Prior to PHP 4.3.3, |ftruncate| returns an integer value of 1 on success,
instead of boolean TRUE.

See also |fopen| and |fseek|.
