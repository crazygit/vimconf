This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfdisplayitem->skewxto| sets the x-skew to {degrees}. For {degrees} is 1.0,
it means a 45-degree forward slant. More is more forward, less is more
backward.

The object may be a |swfshape|, a |swfbutton|, a |swftext| or a |swfsprite|
object. It must have been added using the |swfmovie->add|.
