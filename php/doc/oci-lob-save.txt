lob->save -- Saves data to the large object

  bool lob->save(string data [, int offset])~

Saves {data} to the large object. Parameter {offset} can be used to indicate
offset from the beginning of the large object.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocisavelob| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_lob_save| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

See also |oci_lob_write| and |oci_lob_import|.
