uniqid -- Generate a unique ID

  string uniqid([string prefix [, bool more_entropy]])~

|uniqid| returns a prefixed unique identifier based on the current time in
microseconds. {prefix} is optional but can be useful, for instance, if you
generate identifiers simultaneously on several hosts that might happen to
generate the identifier at the same microsecond. Up until PHP 4.3.1, {prefix}
could only be a maximum of 114 characters long.

If the optional {more_entropy} parameter is TRUE, |uniqid| will add additional
entropy (using the combined linear congruential generator) at the end of the
return value, which should make the results more unique.

With an empty {prefix}, the returned string will be 13 characters long. If
{more_entropy} is TRUE, it will be 23 characters.

The {prefix} parameter became optional in PHP 5.

If you need a unique identifier or token and you intend to give out that token
to the user via the network (i.e. session cookies), it is recommended that you
use something along these lines:

<?php >
  // no prefix
  $token = md5(uniqid());
  
  // better, difficult to guess
  $better_token = md5(uniqid(rand(), true));
?>

This will create a 32 character identifier (a 128 bit hex number) that is
extremely difficult to predict.
