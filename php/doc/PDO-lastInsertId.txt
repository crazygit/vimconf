PDO::lastInsertId -- Returns the ID of the last inserted row or sequence value

  string PDO::lastInsertId([string name])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

Returns the ID of the last inserted row, or the last value from a sequence
object, depending on the underlying driver.

This method may not return a meaningful/consistent result across different PDO
drivers, because the underlying database may not even support the notion of
auto-increment fields or sequences.

{name} Name of the sequence object from which the ID should be returned.

If a sequence name was not specified for the {name} parameter,
|PDOStatement::lastInsertId| returns a string representing the row ID of the
last row that was inserted into the database.

If a sequence name was specified for the {name} parameter,
|PDOStatement::lastInsertId| returns a string representing the last value
retrieved from the specified sequence object.

If the PDO driver does not support this capability, |PDO::lastInsertID|
triggers an IM001 SQLSTATE.
