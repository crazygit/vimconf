SWFMovie->streammp3 -- Streams a MP3 file

  void swfmovie->streammp3(mixed mp3File)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfmovie->streammp3| streams the mp3 file {mp3File}. Not very robust in
dealing with oddities (can skip over an initial ID3 tag, but that's about
it). Like |swfshape->addjpegfill|, this isn't a stable function- we'll
probably need to make a separate SWFSound object to contain sound types.
Parameter {mp3File} can be a |fopen| resource or a binary string.

Note that the movie isn't smart enough to put enough frames in to contain the
entire mp3 stream- you'll have to add (length of song * frames per second)
frames to get the entire stream in.

Yes, now you can use ming to put that rock and roll devil worship music into
your SWF files. Just don't tell the RIAA. |swfmovie->streammp3| example

<?php >
    $m = new SWFMovie();
    $m->setRate(12.0);
    $m->streamMp3(file_get_contents("distortobass.mp3"));
    // use your own MP3
  
    // 11.85 seconds at 12.0 fps = 142 frames
    $m->setFrames(142);
  
    header('Content-type: application/x-shockwave-flash');
    $m->output();
?>
