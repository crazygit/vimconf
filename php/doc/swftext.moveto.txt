SWFText->moveTo -- Moves the pen

  void swftext->moveto(int x, int y)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swftext->moveto| moves the pen (or cursor, if that makes more sense) to
({x},{y}) in text object's coordinate space. If either is zero, though, value
in that dimension stays the same. Annoying, should be fixed.
