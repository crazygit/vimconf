imagecreatefromwbmp -- Create a new image from file or URL

  resource imagecreatefromwbmp(string filename)~

|imagecreatefromwbmp| returns an image identifier representing the image
obtained from the given filename.

|imagecreatefromwbmp| returns an empty string on failure. It also outputs an
error message, which unfortunately displays as a broken link in a browser. To
ease debugging the following example will produce an error WBMP: Example to
handle an error during creation (courtesy vic at zymsys dot com)

<?php >
  function LoadWBMP($imgname) 
  {
      $im = @imagecreatefromwbmp($imgname); /* Attempt to open */
      if (!$im) { /* See if it failed */
          $im  = imagecreate (20, 20); /* Create a blank image */
          $bgc = imagecolorallocate($im, 255, 255, 255);
          $tc  = imagecolorallocate($im, 0, 0, 0);
          imagefilledrectangle($im, 0, 0, 10, 10, $bgc);
          /* Output an errmsg */
          imagestring($im, 1, 5, 5, "Error loading $imgname", $tc);
      }
      return $im;
  }
?>

WBMP support is only available if PHP was compiled against GD-1.8 or later.

You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename and
for a list of supported URL protocols.

Windows versions of PHP prior to PHP 4.3.0 do not support accessing remote
files via this function, even if allow_url_fopen is enabled.
