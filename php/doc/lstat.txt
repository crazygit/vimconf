lstat -- Gives information about a file or symbolic link

  array lstat(string filename)~

Gathers the statistics of the file or symbolic link named by {filename}. This
function is identical to the |stat| function except that if the {filename}
parameter is a symbolic link, the status of the symbolic link is returned,
not the status of the file pointed to by the symbolic link.

See the manual page for |stat| for information on the structure of the array
that |lstat| returns.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0 this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.

See also |stat|.
