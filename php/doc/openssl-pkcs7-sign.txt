openssl_pkcs7_sign -- Sign an S/MIME message

  bool openssl_pkcs7_sign(string infilename, string outfilename, mixed signcert, mixed privkey, array headers [, int flags [, string extracerts]])~

|openssl_pkcs7_sign| takes the contents of the file named {infilename} and
signs them using the certificate and its matching private key specified by
{signcert} and {privkey} parameters.

{headers} is an array of headers that will be prepended to the data after it
has been signed (see |openssl_pkcs7_encrypt| for more information about the
format of this parameter.

{flags} can be used to alter the output - see PKCS7 constants - if not
specified, it defaults to PKCS7_DETACHED.

{extracerts} specifies the name of a file containing a bunch of extra
certificates to include in the signature which can for example be used to
help the recipient to verify the certificate that you used.
