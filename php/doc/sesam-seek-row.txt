sesam_seek_row -- Set scrollable cursor mode for subsequent fetches

  bool sesam_seek_row(string result_id, int whence [, int offset])~

{result_id} is a valid result id (select type queries only, and only if a
"scrollable" cursor was requested when calling |sesam_query|).

{whence} sets the global default value for the scrolling type, it specifies
the scroll type to use in subsequent fetch operations on "scrollable"
cursors, which can be set to the following predefined constants: Valid values
for {"whence"} parameter Value Constant Meaning 0 SESAM_SEEK_NEXT read
sequentially 1 SESAM_SEEK_PRIOR read sequentially backwards 2
SESAM_SEEK_FIRST fetch first row (after fetch, the default is set to
SESAM_SEEK_NEXT) 3 SESAM_SEEK_LAST fetch last row (after fetch, the default
is set to SESAM_SEEK_PRIOR) 4 SESAM_SEEK_ABSOLUTE fetch absolute row number
given as {offset} (Zero-based. After fetch, the default is set to
SESAM_SEEK_ABSOLUTE, and the offset value is auto-incremented) 5
SESAM_SEEK_RELATIVE fetch relative to current scroll position, where {offset}
can be a positive or negative offset value (this also sets the default
"offset" value for subsequent fetches).

{offset} is an optional parameter which is only evaluated (and required) if
{whence} is either SESAM_SEEK_RELATIVE or SESAM_SEEK_ABSOLUTE.
