ocirollback -- Rolls back outstanding transactions

  bool ocirollback(resource connection)~

|ocirollback| rolls back all outstanding statements for Oracle connection
{connection}. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

This function was renamed to |oci_rollback| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For downward
compatibility |ocirollback| can also be used. This is deprecated, however.
