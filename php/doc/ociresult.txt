ociresult -- Returns column value for fetched row

  mixed ociresult(resource statement, mixed col)~

|ociresult| returns the data for column {column} in the current row (see
|ocifetch|). |ociresult| will return everything as strings except for
abstract types (ROWIDs, LOBs and FILEs).

You can either use the column-number (1-Based) or the column-name, in
uppercase, for the {col} parameter.

This function was renamed to |oci_result| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For downward
compatibility |ociresult| can also be used. This is deprecated, however.
