filectime -- Gets inode change time of file

  int filectime(string filename)~

Returns the time the file was last changed, or FALSE in case of an error. The
time is returned as a Unix timestamp.

Note: In most Unix filesystems, a file is considered changed when its inode
data is changed; that is, when the permissions, owner, group, or other
metadata from the inode is updated. See also |filemtime| (which is what you
want to use when you want to create "Last Modified" footers on web pages) and
|fileatime|.

Note also that in some Unix texts the ctime of a file is referred to as being
the creation time of the file. This is wrong. There is no creation time for
Unix files in most Unix filesystems.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0 this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.

A |filectime| example

<?php >
  // outputs e.g.  somefile.txt was last changed: December 29 2002 22:16:23.
  
  $filename = 'somefile.txt';
  if (file_exists($filename)) {
      echo "$filename was last changed: " . date("F d Y H:i:s.", filectime($filename));
  }
?>
