realpath -- Returns canonicalized absolute pathname

  string realpath(string path)~

|realpath| expands all symbolic links and resolves references to '/./', '/../'
and extra '/' characters in the input {path} and return the canonicalized
absolute pathname. The resulting path will have no symbolic link, '/./' or
'/../' components.

|realpath| returns FALSE on failure, e.g. if the file does not exist. On BSD
systems |realpath| doesn't fail if only the last {path} component doesn't
exist, while other systems will return FALSE.

|realpath| example

<?php >
  $real_path = realpath("../../index.php");
?>

See also |basename|, |dirname|, and |pathinfo|.
