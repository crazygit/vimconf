odbc_pconnect -- Open a persistent database connection

  resource odbc_pconnect(string dsn, string user, string password [, int cursor_type])~

Returns an ODBC connection id or 0 (FALSE) on error. This function is much
like |odbc_connect|, except that the connection is not really closed when the
script has finished. Future requests for a connection with the same {dsn},
{user}, {password} combination (via |odbc_connect| and |odbc_pconnect|) can
reuse the persistent connection.

Persistent connections have no effect if PHP is used as a CGI program.

For information about the optional cursor_type parameter see the
|odbc_connect| function. For more information on persistent connections,
refer to the PHP FAQ.
