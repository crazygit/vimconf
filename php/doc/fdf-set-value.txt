fdf_set_value -- Set the value of a field

  bool fdf_set_value(resource fdf_document, string fieldname, mixed value [, int isName])~

The |fdf_set_value| function sets the {value} for a field named {fieldname}.
The {value} will be stored as a string unless it is an array. In this case
all array elements will be stored as a value array.

In older versions of the fdf toolkit last parameter determined if the field
value was to be converted to a PDF Name ({isName} = 1) or set to a PDF String
({isName} = 0). The value is no longer used in the current toolkit version
5.0. For compatibility reasons it is still supported as an optional parameter
beginning with PHP 4.3, but ignored internally.

Support for {value} arrays was added in PHP 4.3.

See also |fdf_get_value| and |fdf_remove_item|.
