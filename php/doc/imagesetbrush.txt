imagesetbrush -- Set the brush image for line drawing

  bool imagesetbrush(resource image, resource brush)~

|imagesetbrush| sets the brush image to be used by all line drawing functions
(such as |imageline| and |imagepolygon|) when drawing with the special colors
IMG_COLOR_BRUSHED or IMG_COLOR_STYLEDBRUSHED.

You need not take special action when you are finished with a brush, but if
you destroy the brush image, you must not use the IMG_COLOR_BRUSHED or
IMG_COLOR_STYLEDBRUSHED colors until you have set a new brush image!

This function was added in PHP 4.0.6
