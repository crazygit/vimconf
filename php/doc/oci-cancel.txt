oci_cancel -- Cancels reading from cursor

  bool oci_cancel(resource stmt)~

|oci_cancel| invalidates a cursor, freeing all associated resources and
cancels the ability to read from it.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocicancel| instead. This name still
can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_cancel| for downwards compatability.
This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
