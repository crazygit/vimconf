ocifetch -- Fetches the next row into result-buffer

  bool ocifetch(resource stmt)~

|ocifetch| fetches the next row (for SELECT statements) into the internal
result-buffer. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

This function was renamed to |oci_fetch| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For downward
compatibility |ocifetch| can also be used. This is deprecated, however.
