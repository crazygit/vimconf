imagecolorclosest -- Get the index of the closest color to the specified color

  int imagecolorclosest(resource image, int red, int green, int blue)~

Returns the index of the color in the palette of the image which is "closest"
to the specified RGB value.

The "distance" between the desired color and each color in the palette is
calculated as if the RGB values represented points in three-dimensional
space.

If you created the image from a file, only colors used in the image are
resolved. Colors present only in the pallete are not resolved.
