imagesavealpha -- Set the flag to save full alpha channel information (as

  bool imagesavealpha(resource image, bool saveflag)~

|imagesavealpha| sets the flag to attempt to save full alpha channel
information (as opposed to single-color transparency) when saving PNG images.

You have to unset alphablending (imagealphablending($im, FALSE)), to use it.

Alpha channel is not supported by all browsers, if you have problem with your
browser, try to load your script with an alpha channel compliant browser,
e.g. latest Mozilla.

This function requires GD 2.0.1 or later.
