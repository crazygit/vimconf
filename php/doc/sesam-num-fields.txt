sesam_num_fields -- Return the number of fields/columns in a result set

  int sesam_num_fields(string result_id)~

After calling |sesam_query| with a "select type" query, this function gives
you the number of columns in the result. Returns an integer describing the
total number of columns (aka. fields) in the current {result_id} result set
or FALSE on error.

For "immediate" statements, the value zero is returned. The SESAM "multiple
field" columns count as their respective dimension, i.e., a three-column
"multiple field" counts as three columns.

See also: |sesam_query| and |sesam_field_array| for a way to distinguish
between "multiple field" columns and regular columns.
