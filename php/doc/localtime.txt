localtime -- Get the local time

  array localtime([int timestamp [, bool is_associative]])~

The |localtime| function returns an array identical to that of the structure
returned by the C function call. The first argument to |localtime| is the
timestamp, if this is not given the current time as returned from |time| is
used. The second argument to the |localtime| is the {is_associative}, if this
is set to FALSE or not supplied than the array is returned as a regular,
numerically indexed array. If the argument is set to TRUE then |localtime| is
an associative array containing all the different elements of the structure
returned by the C function call to localtime. The names of the different keys
of the associative array are as follows: "tm_sec" - seconds

"tm_min" - minutes

"tm_hour" - hour

"tm_mday" - day of the month

"tm_mon" - month of the year, starting with 0 for January

"tm_year" - Years since 1900

"tm_wday" - Day of the week

"tm_yday" - Day of the year

"tm_isdst" - Is daylight savings time in effect

Months are from 0 (Jan) to 11 (Dec) and days of the week are from 0 (Sun) to 6
(Sat).

|time| example

<?php >
  $localtime = localtime();
  $localtime_assoc = localtime(time(), true);
  print_r($localtime);
  print_r($localtime_assoc);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [0] => 24
      [1] => 3
      [2] => 19
      [3] => 3
      [4] => 3
      [5] => 105
      [6] => 0
      [7] => 92
      [9] => 1
  )
  
  Array
  (
      [tm_sec] => 24
      [tm_min] => 3
      [tm_hour] => 19
      [tm_mday] => 3
      [tm_mon] => 3
      [tm_year] => 105
      [tm_wday] => 0
      [tm_yday] => 92
      [tm_isdst] => 1
  )
