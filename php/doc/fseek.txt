fseek -- Seeks on a file pointer

  int fseek(resource handle, int offset [, int whence])~

Sets the file position indicator for the file referenced by {handle}. The new
position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file, is obtained by
adding {offset} to the position specified by {whence}, whose values are
defined as follows: SEEK_SET - Set position equal to {offset} bytes. SEEK_CUR
- Set position to current location plus {offset}. SEEK_END - Set position to
end-of-file plus {offset}. (To move to a position before the end-of-file, you
need to pass a negative value in {offset}.)

If {whence} is not specified, it is assumed to be SEEK_SET.

Upon success, returns 0; otherwise, returns -1. Note that seeking past EOF is
not considered an error.

|fseek| example

<?php >
  $fp = fopen('somefile.txt');
  
  // read some data
  $data = fgets($fp, 4096);
  
  // move back to the beginning of the file
  // same as rewind($fp);
  fseek($fp, 0);
?>

May not be used on file pointers returned by |fopen| if they use the "http://"
or "ftp://" formats. |fseek| gives also undefined results for append-only
streams (opened with "a" flag).

The {whence} argument was added after PHP 4.0.0.

If you have opened the file in append ("a" or "a+") mode, any data you write
to the file will always be appended, regardless of the file position.

See also |ftell| and |rewind|.
