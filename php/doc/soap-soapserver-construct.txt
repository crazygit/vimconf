SoapServer->__construct() -- SoapServer constructor

This constructor allows the creation of SoapServer objects in WSDL or non-WSDL
mode.

{wsdl} If you want the WSDL mode, you must set this to the URI of a WSDL file.
In the other case, you must set this to NULL and set the uri option.

{options} Allow setting a default SOAP version (soap_version), internal
character encoding (encoding), and actor URI (actor). The classmap option can
be used to map some WSDL types to PHP classes. This option must be an array
with WSDL types as keys and names of PHP classes as values.

Some examples

<?php >
  $server = new SoapServer("some.wsdl");
  
  $server = new SoapServer("some.wsdl", array('soap_version' => SOAP_1_2));
  
  $server = new SoapServer("some.wsdl", array('actor' => "http://example.org/ts-tests/C"));
  
  $server = new SoapServer("some.wsdl", array('encoding'=>'ISO-8859-1'));
  
  $server = new SoapServer(null, array('uri' => "http://test-uri/"));
  
  class MyBook {
      public $title;
      public $author;
  }
  
  $server = new SoapServer("books.wsdl", array('classmap' => array('book' => "MyBook")));
?>
