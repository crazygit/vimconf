posix_getgrgid -- Return info about a group by group id

  array posix_getgrgid(int gid)~

Returns an array of information about a group and FALSE on failure. If {gid}
isn't a number then NULL is returned and an E_WARNING level error is
generated.

Example use of |posix_getgrgid|

<?php >
  $groupid   = posix_getegid();
  $groupinfo = posix_getgrgid($groupid);
  
  print_r($groupinfo);
?>

An example output:

  Array
  (
      [name]    => toons
      [passwd]  => x
      [members] => Array 
          ( 
              [0] => tom
              [1] => jerry
          )
      [gid]     => 42
  )

As of PHP 4.2.0, members is returned as an array of member usernames in the
group. Before this time it was simply an integer (the number of members in
the group) and the member names were returned with numerical indices.
