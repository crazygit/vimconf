imagejpeg -- Output image to browser or file

  bool imagejpeg(resource image [, string filename [, int quality]])~

|imagejpeg| creates the JPEG file in filename from the image {image}. The
{image} argument is the return from the |imagecreate| function.

The filename argument is optional, and if left off, the raw image stream will
be output directly. To skip the filename argument in order to provide a
quality argument just use an empty string (''). By sending an image/jpeg
content-type using |header|, you can create a PHP script that outputs JPEG
images directly.

JPEG support is only available if PHP was compiled against GD-1.8 or later.

{quality} is optional, and ranges from 0 (worst quality, smaller file) to 100
(best quality, biggest file). The default is the default IJG quality value
(about 75).

If you want to output Progressive JPEGs, you need to set interlacing on with
|imageinterlace|.

See also |imagepng|, |imagegif|, |imagewbmp|, |imageinterlace| and
|imagetypes|.
