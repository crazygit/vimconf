imagepsencodefont -- Change the character encoding vector of a font

  bool imagepsencodefont(resource font_index, string encodingfile)~

Loads a character encoding vector from a file and changes the fonts encoding
vector to it. As a PostScript fonts default vector lacks most of the
character positions above 127, you'll definitely want to change this if you
use an other language than English. The exact format of this file is
described in T1libs documentation. T1lib comes with two ready-to-use files,
IsoLatin1.enc and IsoLatin2.enc.

If you find yourself using this function all the time, a much better way to
define the encoding is to set ps.default_encoding in the configuration file
to point to the right encoding file and all fonts you load will automatically
have the right encoding.

This function is only available if PHP is compiled using --with-t1lib[=DIR].
