is_a -- Returns TRUE if the object is of this class or has this class as one
of its parents

  bool is_a(object object, string class_name)~

This function returns TRUE if the object is of this class or has this class as
one of its parents, FALSE otherwise.

|is_a| example

<?php >
  // define a class
  class WidgetFactory
  {
    var $oink = 'moo';
  }
  
  // create a new object
  $WF = new WidgetFactory();
  
  if (is_a($WF, 'WidgetFactory')) {
    echo "yes, \$WF is still a WidgetFactory\n";
  }
?>

The |is_a| function is deprecated as of PHP 5 in favor of the instanceof type
operator. In the above example we could use the following in PHP 5:

Using the instanceof operator in PHP 5

<?php >
  if ($WF instanceof WidgetFactory) {
      echo 'Yes, $WF is a WidgetFactory';
  }
?>
