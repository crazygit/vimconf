fam_monitor_directory -- Monitor a directory for changes

  resource fam_monitor_directory(resource fam, string dirname)~

|fam_monitor_directory| requests monitoring for a directory and all contained
files. A FAM event will be generated whenever the status of the directory
(i.e. the result of function |stat| on that directory) or its content (i.e.
the results of |readdir|) change.

The possible event codes are described in detail in the constants part of this
section.
