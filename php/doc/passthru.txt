passthru -- Execute an external program and display raw output

  void passthru(string command [, int return_var])~

The |passthru| function is similar to the |exec| function in that it executes
a {command}. This function should be used in place of |exec| or |system| when
the output from the Unix command is binary data which needs to be passed
directly back to the browser. A common use for this is to execute something
like the pbmplus utilities that can output an image stream directly. By
setting the Content-type to image/gif and then calling a pbmplus program to
output a gif, you can create PHP scripts that output images directly.

{command} The command that will be executed.

{return_var} If the {return_var} argument is present, the return status of the
Unix command will be placed here.

If you are going to allow data coming from user input to be passed to this
function, then you should be using |escapeshellarg| or |escapeshellcmd| to
make sure that users cannot trick the system into executing arbitrary
commands.

If you start a program using this function and want to leave it running in the
background, you have to make sure that the output of that program is
redirected to a file or some other output stream or else PHP will hang until
the execution of the program ends.

When safe mode is enabled, you can only execute executables within the
safe_mode_exec_dir. For practical reasons it is currently not allowed to have
.. components in the path to the executable.

With safe mode enabled, all words following the initial command string are
treated as a single argument. Thus, echo y | echo x becomes echo "y | echo
x".

|exec| |system| |popen| |escapeshellcmd| backtick operator
