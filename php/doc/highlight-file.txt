highlight_file -- Syntax highlighting of a file

  mixed highlight_file(string filename [, bool return])~

The |highlight_file| function prints out a syntax highlighted version of the
code contained in {filename} using the colors defined in the built-in syntax
highlighter for PHP.

If the second parameter {return} is set to TRUE then |highlight_file| will
return the highlighted code as a string instead of printing it out. If the
second parameter is not set to TRUE then |highlight_file| will return TRUE on
success, FALSE on failure.

The {return} parameter became available in PHP 4.2.0. Before this time it
behaved like the default, which is FALSE

Since PHP 4.2.1 this function is also affected by safe_mode and open_basedir.

Care should be taken when using the |highlight_file| function to make sure
that you do not inadvertently reveal sensitive information such as passwords
or any other type of information that might create a potential security risk.

Many servers are configured to automatically highlight files with a phps
extension. For example, example.phps when viewed will show the syntax
highlighted source of the file. To enable this, add this line to the
httpd.conf:

  AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
