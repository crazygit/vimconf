imagegd -- Output GD image to browser or file

  bool imagegd(resource image [, string filename])~

|imagegd| outputs a GD image to {filename}. The {image} argument is the return
from the |imagecreate| function.

The {filename} parameter is optional, and if left off, the raw image stream
will be output directly.

The GD format is commonly used to allow fast loading of parts of images. Note
that the GD format is only usable in GD-compatible applications.

See also |imagegd2|.
