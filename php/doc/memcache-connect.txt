Memcache::connect -- Open memcached server connection

  bool Memcache::connect(string host [, int port [, int timeout]])~

|Memcache::connect| establishes a connection to the memcached server.
Parameters {host} and {port} point to the host and port, where memcached is
listening for connections. Parameter {port} is optional, it's default value
is 11211. Also you can define a {timeout} (in seconds), which will be used
when connecting to the daemon. Think twice before changing the default value
- you can loose all the advantages of caching if your connection is too slow.

The connection, which was opened using |Memcache::connect| will be
automatically closed at the end of script execution. Also you can close it
with |Memcache::close|.

Also you can use |memcache_connect| function. See example below.

|Memcache::connect| example

<?php >
  /* procedural API */
  
  $memcache_obj = memcache_connect('memcache_host', 11211);
  
  /* OO API */
  
  $memcache = new Memcache;
  $memcache->connect('memcache_host', 11211);
?>

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
