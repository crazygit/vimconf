dirname -- Returns directory name component of path

  string dirname(string path)~

Given a string containing a path to a file, this function will return the name
of the directory.

On Windows, both slash (/) and backslash (\) are used as directory separator
character. In other environments, it is the forward slash (/).

|dirname| example

<?php >
  $path = "/etc/passwd";
  $file = dirname($path); // $file is set to "/etc"
?>

In PHP 4.0.3, |dirname| was fixed to be POSIX-compliant. Essentially, this
means that if there are no slashes in {path} , a dot ('.') is returned,
indicating the current directory. Otherwise, the returned string is {path}
with any trailing /component removed. Note that this means that you will
often get a slash or a dot back from |dirname| in situations where the older
functionality would have given you the empty string.

|dirname| has changed its behaviour in PHP 4.3.0. Check the following
examples:

<?php >
  //before PHP 4.3.0
  dirname('c:/'); // returned '.'
  
  //after PHP 4.3.0
  dirname('c:/'); // returns 'c:'
?>

|dirname| has been binary safe since PHP 5.0.0

See also |basename|, |pathinfo|, and |realpath|.
