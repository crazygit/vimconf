mb_convert_case -- Perform case folding on a string

  string mb_convert_case(string str, int mode [, string encoding])~

|mb_convert_case| returns case folded version of {string} converted in the way
specified by {mode}.

{mode} can be one of MB_CASE_UPPER, MB_CASE_LOWER or MB_CASE_TITLE.

{encoding} specifies the encoding of {str}; if omitted, the internal character
encoding value will be used.

The return value is str with the appropriate case folding applied.

By contrast to the standard case folding functions such as |strtolower| and
|strtoupper|, case folding is performed on the basis of the Unicode character
properties. Thus the behaviour of this function is not affected by locale
settings and it can convert any characters that have 'alphabetic' property,
such as A-umlaut (&Auml;).

For more information about the Unicode properties, please see
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/.

|mb_convert_case| example

<?php >
  $str = "mary had a Little lamb and she loved it so";
  $str = mb_convert_case($str, MB_CASE_UPPER, "UTF-8");
  echo $str; // Prints MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB AND SHE LOVED IT SO
  $str = mb_convert_case($str, MB_CASE_TITLE, "UTF-8");
  echo $str; // Prints Mary Had A Little Lamb And She Loved It So
?>
