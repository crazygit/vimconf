SWFText->setSpacing -- Sets the current font spacing

  void swftext->setspacing(float spacing)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swftext->setspacing| sets the current font spacing to {spacing}{spacing}.
Default is 1.0. 0 is all of the letters written at the same point. This
doesn't really work that well because it inflates the advance across the
letter, doesn't add the same amount of spacing between the letters. I should
try and explain that better, prolly. Or just fix the damn thing to do
constant spacing. This was really just a way to figure out how letter
advances work, anyway.. So nyah.
