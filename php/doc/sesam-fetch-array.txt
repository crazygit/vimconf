sesam_fetch_array -- Fetch one row as an associative array

  array sesam_fetch_array(string result_id [, int whence [, int offset]])~

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

|sesam_fetch_array| is an alternative version of |sesam_fetch_row|. Instead of
storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it stores the
data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.

{result_id} is a valid result id returned by |sesam_query| (select type
queries only!).

For the valid values of the optional {whence}and {offset} parameters, see the
|sesam_fetch_row| function for details.

|sesam_fetch_array| fetches one row of data from the result associated with
the specified result identifier. The row is returned as an associative array.
Each result column is stored with an associative index equal to its column
(aka. field) name. The column names are converted to lower case.

Columns without a field name (e.g., results of arithmetic operations) and
empty fields are not stored in the array. Also, if two or more columns of the
result have the same column names, the later column will take precedence. In
this situation, either call |sesam_fetch_row| or make an alias for the
column.

  SELECT TBL1.COL AS FOO, TBL2.COL AS BAR FROM TBL1, TBL2

A special handling allows fetching "multiple field" columns (which would
otherwise all have the same column names). For each column of a "multiple
field", the index name is constructed by appending the string "(n)" where n
is the sub-index of the multiple field column, ranging from 1 to its declared
repetition factor. The indices are NOT zero based, in order to match the
nomenclature used in the respective query syntax. For a column declared as:

  CREATE TABLE ... ( ... MULTI(3) INT )

the associative indices used for the individual "multiple field" columns would
be "multi(1)", "multi(2)", and "multi(3)" respectively.

Subsequent calls to |sesam_fetch_array| would return the next (or prior, or
n'th next/prior, depending on the scroll attributes) row in the result set,
or FALSE if there are no more rows.

SESAM fetch array

<?php >
  $result = sesam_query("SELECT * FROM phone\n" .
                         "  WHERE LASTNAME='" . strtoupper($name) . "'\n".
                         "  ORDER BY FIRSTNAME", 1);
  if (!$result) {
      /* ... error ... */
  }
  // print the table:
  echo "<table border=\"1\">\n";
  while (($row = sesam_fetch_array($result)) &amp;& count($row) > 0) {
      echo "<tr>\n";
      echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["firstname"]) . "</td>\n";
      echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["lastname"]) . "</td>\n";
      echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["phoneno"]) . "</td>\n";
      echo "</tr>\n";
  }
  echo "</table>\n";
  sesam_free_result($result);
?>
