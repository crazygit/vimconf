ifx_connect -- Open Informix server connection

  int ifx_connect([string database [, string userid [, string password]]])~

Returns a connection identifier on success, or FALSE on error.

|ifx_connect| establishes a connection to an Informix server. All of the
arguments are optional, and if they're missing, defaults are taken from
values supplied in configuration file (ifx.default_host for the host
(Informix libraries will use INFORMIXSERVER environment value if not
defined), ifx.default_user for user, ifx.default_password for the password
(none if not defined).

In case a second call is made to |ifx_connect| with the same arguments, no new
link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling |ifx_close|.
