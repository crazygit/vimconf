PDO::quote -- Quotes a string for use in a query.

  string PDO::quote(string string [, int parameter_type])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|PDO::quote| places quotes around the input string and escapes and single
quotes within the input string, using a quoting style appropriate to the
underlying driver.

If you're using this function to build SQL, it is recommended that you using
prepared statements and bound parameters instead, as it is not only more
convenient, but often much faster.

Not all PDO drivers implement this method (notably PDO_ODBC). Consider using
prepared statements instead.

{string} The string to be quoted.

{parameter_type} Provides a data type hint for drivers that have alternate
quoting styles. The default value is PDO_PARAM_STR.

Returns a quoted string that is theoretically safe to pass into an SQL
statement. Returns FALSE if the driver does not support quoting in this way.

Quoting a normal string

<?php >
  $conn = new PDO('sqlite:/home/lynn/music.sql3');
  
  /* Simple string */
  $string = 'Nice';
  print "Unquoted string: $string\n";
  print "Quoted string: " . $conn->quote($string) . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  Unquoted string: Nice
  Quoted string: 'Nice'

Quoting a dangerous string

<?php >
  $conn = new PDO('sqlite:/home/lynn/music.sql3');
  
  /* Dangerous string */
  $string = 'Naughty \' string';
  print "Unquoted string: $string\n";
  print "Quoted string:" . $conn->quote($string) . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  Unquoted string: Naughty ' string
  Quoted string: 'Naughty '' string'

Quoting a complex string

<?php >
  $conn = new PDO('sqlite:/home/lynn/music.sql3');
  
  /* Complex string */
  $string = "Co'mpl''ex \"st'\"ring";
  print "Unquoted string: $string\n";
  print "Quoted string: " . $conn->quote($string) . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  Unquoted string: Co'mpl''ex "st'"ring
  Quoted string: 'Co''mpl''''ex "st''"ring'
