imagepscopyfont -- Make a copy of an already loaded font for further
modification

  int imagepscopyfont(resource fontindex)~

Use this function if you need make further modifications to the font, for
example extending/condensing, slanting it or changing its character encoding
vector, but need to keep the original along as well. Note that the font you
want to copy must be one obtained using |imagepsloadfont|, not a font that is
itself a copied one. You can although make modifications to it before copying.

If you use this function, you must free the fonts obtained this way yourself
and in reverse order. Otherwise your script will hang.

In the case everything went right, a valid font index will be returned and can
be used for further purposes. Otherwise the function returns FALSE and prints
a message describing what went wrong.

This function is only available if PHP is compiled using --with-t1lib[=DIR].
