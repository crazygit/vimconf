linkinfo -- Gets information about a link

  int linkinfo(string path)~

|linkinfo| returns the st_dev field of the Unix C stat structure returned by
the lstat system call. This function is used to verify if a link (pointed to
by {path}) really exists (using the same method as the S_ISLNK macro defined
in stat.h). Returns 0 or FALSE in case of error.

|linkinfo| example

<?php >
  echo linkinfo('/vmlinuz'); // 835
?>

This function is not implemented on Windows platforms.

See also |symlink|, |link|, and |readlink|.
