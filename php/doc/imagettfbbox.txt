imagettfbbox -- Give the bounding box of a text using TrueType fonts

  array imagettfbbox(float size, float angle, string fontfile, string text)~

This function calculates and returns the bounding box in pixels for a TrueType
text. {text} The string to be measured.

{size} The font size in pixels.

{fontfile} The name of the TrueType font file (can be a URL). Depending on
which version of the GD library that PHP is using, it may attempt to search
for files that do not begin with a leading '/' by appending '.ttf' to the
filename and searching along a library-defined font path.

{angle} Angle in degrees in which {text} will be measured.

|imagettfbbox| returns an array with 8 elements representing four points
making the bounding box of the text: 0 lower left corner, X position 1 lower
left corner, Y position 2 lower right corner, X position 3 lower right
corner, Y position 4 upper right corner, X position 5 upper right corner, Y
position 6 upper left corner, X position 7 upper left corner, Y position The
points are relative to the text regardless of the angle, so "upper left"
means in the top left-hand corner seeing the text horizontally.

This function requires both the GD library and the FreeType library.
