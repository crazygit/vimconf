DOMText->splitText() -- Breaks this node into two nodes at the specified
offset

  DOMText splitText(int offset)~

Breaks this node into two nodes at the specified {offset}, keeping both in the
tree as siblings.

After being split, this node will contain all the content up to the {offset}.
If the original node had a parent node, the new node is inserted as the next
sibling of the original node. When the {offset} is equal to the length of
this node, the new node has no data.

{offset} The offset at which to split, starting from 0.

The new node of the same type, which contains all the content at and after the
{offset}.
