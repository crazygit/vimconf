gettype -- Get the type of a variable

  string gettype(mixed var)~

Returns the type of the PHP variable {var}.

Never use |gettype| to test for a certain type, since the returned string may
be subject to change in a future version. In addition, it is slow too, as it
involves string comparison.

Instead, use the is_* functions.

Possibles values for the returned string are: "boolean" (since PHP 4)

"integer"

"double" (for historical reasons "double" is returned in case of a float, and
not simply "float")

"string"

"array"

"object"

"resource" (since PHP 4)

"NULL" (since PHP 4)

"user function" (PHP 3 only, deprecated)

"unknown type"

For PHP 4, you should use |function_exists| and |method_exists| to replace the
prior usage of |gettype| on a function.

See also |settype|, |is_array|, |is_bool|, |is_float|, |is_int|, |is_null|,
|is_numeric|, |is_object|, |is_resource|, |is_scalar|, and |is_string|.
