fbsql_set_lob_mode -- Set the LOB retrieve mode for a FrontBase result set

  bool fbsql_set_lob_mode(resource result, string database_name)~

Returns: TRUE on success, FALSE on error.

|fbsql_set_lob_mode| sets the mode for retrieving LOB data from the database.
When BLOB and CLOB data is stored in FrontBase it can be stored direct or
indirect. Direct stored LOB data will always be fetched no matter the setting
of the lob mode. If the LOB data is less than 512 bytes it will always be
stored directly. FBSQL_LOB_DIRECT - LOB data is retrieved directly. When data
is fetched from the database with |fbsql_fetch_row|, and other fetch
functions, all CLOB and BLOB columns will be returned as ordinary columns.
This is the default value on a new FrontBase result.

FBSQL_LOB_HANDLE - LOB data is retrieved as handles to the data. When data is
fetched from the database with |fbsql_fetch_row |, and other fetch functions,
LOB data will be returned as a handle to the data if the data is stored
indirect or the data if it is stored direct. If a handle is returned it will
be a 27 byte string formatted as "@'000000000000000000000000'".
