SWFFont -- Loads a font definition

  SWFFont swffont(string filename)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

If {filename} is the name of an FDB file (i.e., it ends in ".fdb"), load the
font definition found in said file. Otherwise, create a browser-defined font
reference.

FDB ("font definition block") is a very simple wrapper for the SWF DefineFont2
block which contains a full description of a font. One may create FDB files
from SWT Generator template files with the included makefdb utility- look in
the util directory off the main ming distribution directory.

Browser-defined fonts don't contain any information about the font other than
its name. It is assumed that the font definition will be provided by the
movie player. The fonts _serif, _sans, and _typewriter should always be
available. For example:

<?php >
  $f = newSWFFont("_sans"); 
?>
