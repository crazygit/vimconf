gmdate -- Format a GMT/UTC date/time

  string gmdate(string format [, int timestamp])~

Identical to the |date| function except that the time returned is Greenwich
Mean Time (GMT). For example, when run in Finland (GMT +0200), the first line
below prints "Jan 01 1998 00:00:00", while the second prints "Dec 31 1997
22:00:00". |gmdate| example

<?php >
  echo date("M d Y H:i:s", mktime(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1998));
  echo gmdate("M d Y H:i:s", mktime(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1998));
?>

In the Microsoft Windows series of Operating Systems the system libraries
implementing this function are broken, so |gmdate| does not support negative
values for the {timestamp}. For details see bug reports: #22620, #22457, and
#14391.

This problem does not occur in Unix/Linux Operating Systems, as the system
libraries behave as expected.

PHP cannot fix broken system libraries. Contact your OS vendor for a fix to
this and similar problems.

See also |date|, |mktime|, |gmmktime| and |strftime|.
