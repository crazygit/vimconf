imagecreatefromxpm -- Create a new image from file or URL

  resource imagecreatefromxpm(string filename)~

|imagecreatefromxpm| returns an image identifier representing the image
obtained from the given filename.

This function is only available if PHP is compiled with the bundled version of
the GD library.

You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename and
for a list of supported URL protocols.

Windows versions of PHP prior to PHP 4.3.0 do not support accessing remote
files via this function, even if allow_url_fopen is enabled.
