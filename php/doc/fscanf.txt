fscanf -- Parses input from a file according to a format

  mixed fscanf(resource handle, string format [, mixed ...])~

The function |fscanf| is similar to |sscanf|, but it takes its input from a
file associated with {handle} and interprets the input according to the
specified {format}, which is described in the documentation for |sprintf|. If
only two parameters were passed to this function, the values parsed will be
returned as an array. Otherwise, if optional parameters are passed, the
function will return the number of assigned values. The optional parameters
must be passed by reference.

Any whitespace in the format string matches any whitespace in the input
stream. This means that even a tab \t in the format string can match a single
space character in the input stream.

|fscanf| Example

<?php >
  $handle = fopen("users.txt", "r");
  while ($userinfo = fscanf($handle, "%s\t%s\t%s\n")) {
      list ($name, $profession, $countrycode) = $userinfo;
      //... do something with the values
  }
  fclose($handle);
?>

Contents of users.txt

Prior to PHP 4.3.0, the maximum number of characters read from the file was
512 (or up to the first \n, whichever came first). As of PHP 4.3.0
arbitrarily long lines will be read and scanned.
