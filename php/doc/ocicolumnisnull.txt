ocicolumnisnull -- Test whether a result column is NULL

  bool ocicolumnisnull(resource stmt, mixed col)~

|ocicolumnisnull| returns TRUE if the returned column {column} in the result
from the statement {stmt} is NULL. You can either use the column-number
(1-Based) or the column-name, in uppercase, for the {col} parameter.

This function was renamed to |oci_field_is_null| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For
downward compatibility |ocicolumnisnull| can also be used. This is
deprecated, however.
