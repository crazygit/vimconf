this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfbutton->addshape| adds the shape {shape} to this button. The following
{flags}' values are valid: SWFBUTTON_UP, SWFBUTTON_OVER, SWFBUTTON_DOWN or
SWFBUTTON_HIT. SWFBUTTON_HIT isn't ever displayed, it defines the hit region
for the button. That is, everywhere the hit shape would be drawn is
considered a "touchable" part of the button.
