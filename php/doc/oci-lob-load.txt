lob->load -- Returns large object's contents

  string lob->load()~

Returns large object's contents. As script execution is terminated when the
memory_limit is reached, ensure that the LOB does not exceed this limit. In
most cases it's recommended to use |oci_lob_read| instead. In case of error
|lob->load| returns FALSE.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ociloadlob| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_lob_load| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
