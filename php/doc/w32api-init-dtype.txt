w32api_init_dtype -- Creates an instance of the data type typename and fills
it with the values passed

  resource w32api_init_dtype(string typename, mixed value [, mixed ...])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

This function creates an instance of the data type named {typename}, filling
in the values of the data type. The {typename} parameter is case sensitive.
You should give the values in the same order as you defined the data type
with |w32api_deftype|. The type of the resource returned is dynaparm.
