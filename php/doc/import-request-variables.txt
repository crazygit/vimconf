import_request_variables -- Import GET/POST/Cookie variables into the global
scope

  bool import_request_variables(string types [, string prefix])~

Imports GET/POST/Cookie variables into the global scope. It is useful if you
disabled register_globals, but would like to see some variables in the global
scope.

Using the {types} parameter, you can specify which request variables to
import. You can use 'G', 'P' and 'C' characters respectively for GET, POST
and Cookie. These characters are not case sensitive, so you can also use any
combination of 'g', 'p' and 'c'. POST includes the POST uploaded file
information. Note that the order of the letters matters, as when using "gp",
the POST variables will overwrite GET variables with the same name. Any other
letters than GPC are discarded.

The {prefix} parameter is used as a variable name prefix, prepended before all
variable's name imported into the global scope. So if you have a GET value
named "userid", and provide a prefix "pref_", then you'll get a global
variable named $pref_userid.

If you're interested in importing other variables into the global scope, such
as SERVER, consider using |extract|.

Although the {prefix} parameter is optional, you will get an E_NOTICE level
error if you specify no prefix, or specify an empty string as a prefix. This
is a possible security hazard. Notice level errors are not displayed using
the default error reporting level.

<?php >
  // This will import GET and POST vars
  // with an "rvar_" prefix
  import_request_variables("gP", "rvar_");
  
  echo $rvar_foo;
?>
