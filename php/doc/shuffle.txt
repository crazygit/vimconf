shuffle -- Shuffle an array

  bool shuffle(array array)~

This function shuffles (randomizes the order of the elements in) an array.
|shuffle| example

<?php >
  $numbers = range(1, 20);
  srand((float)microtime() * 1000000);
  shuffle($numbers);
  foreach ($numbers as $number) {
      echo "$number ";
  }
?>

As of PHP 4.2.0, there is no need to seed the random number generator with
|srand| or |mt_srand| as this is now done automatically.
