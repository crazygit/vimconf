ob_implicit_flush -- Turn implicit flush on/off

  void ob_implicit_flush([int flag])~

|ob_implicit_flush| will turn implicit flushing on or off (if no {flag} is
given, it defaults to on). Implicit flushing will result in a flush operation
after every output call, so that explicit calls to |flush| will no longer be
needed.

Turning implicit flushing on will disable output buffering, the output buffers
current output will be sent as if |ob_end_flush| had been called.

See also |flush|, |ob_start|, and |ob_end_flush|.
