stream_get_line -- Gets line from stream resource up to a given delimiter

  string stream_get_line(resource handle, int length [, string ending])~

Returns a string of up to {length} bytes read from the file pointed to by
{handle}. Reading ends when {length} bytes have been read, when the string
specified by {ending} is found (which is not included in the return value),
or on EOF (whichever comes first).

If an error occurs, returns FALSE.

This function is nearly identical to |fgets| except in that it allows end of
line delimiters other than the standard \n, \r, and \r\n, and does not return
the delimiter itself.

See also |fread|, |fgets|, and |fgetc|.
