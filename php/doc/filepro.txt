filepro -- Read and verify the map file

  bool filepro(string directory)~

This reads and verifies the map file, storing the field count and info.

No locking is done, so you should avoid modifying your filePro database while
it may be opened in PHP.

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories you are
about to operate on have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being
executed.
