flush -- Flush the output buffer

  void flush()~

Flushes the output buffers of PHP and whatever backend PHP is using (CGI, a
web server, etc). This effectively tries to push all the output so far to the
user's browser.

|flush| has no effect on the buffering scheme of your webserver or the browser
on the client side. Thus you need to call both |ob_flush| and |flush| to flush
the output buffers.

Several servers, especially on Win32, will still buffer the output from your
script until it terminates before transmitting the results to the browser.

Server modules for Apache like mod_gzip may do buffering of their own that
will cause |flush| to not result in data being sent immediately to the
client.
