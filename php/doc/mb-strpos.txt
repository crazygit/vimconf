mb_strpos -- Find position of first occurrence of string in a string

  int mb_strpos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset [, string encoding]])~

|mb_strpos| returns the numeric position of the first occurrence of {needle}
in the {haystack} string. If {needle} is not found, it returns FALSE.

|mb_strpos| performs multi-byte safe |strpos| operation based on number of
characters. {needle} position is counted from the beginning of the
{haystack}. First character's position is 0. Second character position is 1,
and so on.

If {encoding} is omitted, internal character encoding is used. |mb_strrpos|
accepts string for {needle} where |strrpos| accepts only character.

{offset} is search offset. If it is not specified, 0 is used.

{encoding} is character encoding name. If it is omitted, internal character
encoding is used.
