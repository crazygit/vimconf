sesam_execimm -- Execute an "immediate" SQL-statement

  string sesam_execimm(string query)~

Returns: A SESAM "result identifier" on success, or FALSE on error.

|sesam_execimm| executes an "immediate" statement (i.e., a statement like
UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE which returns no result, and has no INPUT or OUTPUT
variables). "select type" queries can not be used with |sesam_execimm|. Sets
the {affected_rows} value for retrieval by the |sesam_affected_rows|
function.

Note that |sesam_query| can handle both "immediate" and "select-type" queries.
Use |sesam_execimm| only if you know beforehand what type of statement will be
executed. An attempt to use SELECT type queries with |sesam_execimm| will
return $err["sqlstate"] == "42SBW".

The returned "result identifier" can not be used for retrieving anything but
the |sesam_affected_rows|; it is only returned for symmetry with the
|sesam_query| function.

<?php >
  $stmt = "INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('one', 'two')";
  $result = sesam_execimm($stmt);
  $err = sesam_diagnostic();
  echo "sqlstate = " . $err["sqlstate"] . "\n".
         "Affected rows = " . $err["rowcount"] . " == " .
         sesam_affected_rows($result) . "\n";
?>
