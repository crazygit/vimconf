stream_set_timeout -- Set timeout period on a stream

  bool stream_set_timeout(resource stream, int seconds [, int microseconds])~

Sets the timeout value on {stream}, expressed in the sum of {seconds} and
{microseconds}. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

When the stream times out, the 'timed_out' key of the array returned by
|stream_get_meta_data| is set to TRUE, although no error/warning is
generated.

|stream_set_timeout| example

<?php >
  $fp = fsockopen("www.example.com", 80);
  if (!$fp) {
      echo "Unable to open\n";
  } else {
  
      fwrite($fp, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n");
      stream_set_timeout($fp, 2);
      $res = fread($fp, 2000);
  
      $info = stream_get_meta_data($fp);
      fclose($fp);
  
      if ($info['timed_out']) {
          echo 'Connection timed out!';
      } else {
          echo $res;
      }
  
  }
?>

As of PHP 4.3, this function can (potentially) work on any kind of stream. In
PHP 4.3, socket based streams are still the only kind supported in the PHP
core, although streams from other extensions may support this function.

This function was previously called as |set_socket_timeout| and later
|socket_set_timeout| but this usage is deprecated.

See also |fsockopen| and |fopen|.
