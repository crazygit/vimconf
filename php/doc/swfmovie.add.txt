SWFMovie->add -- Adds any type of data to a movie

  void swfmovie->add(resource instance)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfmovie->add| adds {instance} to the current movie. {instance} is any type
of data : Shapes, text, fonts, etc. must all be added to the movie to make
this work.

For displayable types (shape, text, button, sprite), this returns an
|swfdisplayitem|, a handle to the object in a display list. Thus, you can add
the same shape to a movie multiple times and get separate handles back for
each separate instance.

See also all other objects (adding this later), and |swfmovie->remove|

See examples in : |swfdisplayitem->rotateto| and |swfshape->addfill|.
