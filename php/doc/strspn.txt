strspn -- Find length of initial segment matching mask

  int strspn(string str1, string str2 [, int start [, int length]])~

Returns the length of the initial segment of {str1} which consists entirely of
characters in {str2}.

The line of code:

<?php >
  $var = strspn("42 is the answer, what is the question ...", "1234567890");
?>

will assign 2 to $var, because the string "42" will be the longest segment
containing characters from "1234567890".

As of PHP 4.3.0, |strspn| accepts two optional integer parameters that can be
used to define the {start} position and the {length} of the string to
examine.

<?php >
  echo strspn("foo", "o", 1, 2); // 2
?>

This function is binary-safe.
