imap_utf7_decode -- Decodes a modified UTF-7 encoded string

  string imap_utf7_decode(string text)~

Decodes modified UTF-7 {text} into ISO-8859-1 string.

Returns a string that is encoded in ISO-8859-1 and consists of the same
sequence of characters in {text}, or FALSE if {text} contains invalid
modified UTF-7 sequence or {text} contains a character that is not part of
ISO-8859-1 character set.

characters which are not in range of printable ASCII characters.

UTF-7 was defined in RFC1642).
