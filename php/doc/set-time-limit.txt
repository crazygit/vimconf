set_time_limit -- Limits the maximum execution time

  void set_time_limit(int seconds)~

Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If this is reached, the
script returns a fatal error. The default limit is 30 seconds or, if it
exists, the max_execution_time value defined in the php.ini. If {seconds} is
set to zero, no time limit is imposed.

When called, |set_time_limit| restarts the timeout counter from zero. In other
words, if the timeout is the default 30 seconds, and 25 seconds into script
execution a call such as set_time_limit(20) is made, the script will run for
a total of 45 seconds before timing out.

|set_time_limit| has no effect when PHP is running in safe mode. There is no
workaround other than turning off safe mode or changing the time limit in the
php.ini.

The |set_time_limit| function and the configuration directive
max_execution_time only affect the execution time of the script itself. Any
time spent on activity that happens outside the execution of the script such
as system calls using |system|, stream operations, database queries, etc. is
not included when determining the maximum time that the script has been
running.
