htmlentities -- Convert all applicable characters to HTML entities

  string htmlentities(string string [, int quote_style [, string charset]])~

This function is identical to |htmlspecialchars| in all ways, except with
|htmlentities|, all characters which have HTML character entity equivalents
are translated into these entities.

Like |htmlspecialchars|, the optional second {quote_style} parameter lets you
define what will be done with 'single' and "double" quotes. It takes on one
of three constants with the default being ENT_COMPAT: Available {quote_style}
constants Constant Name Description ENT_COMPAT Will convert double-quotes and
leave single-quotes alone. ENT_QUOTES Will convert both double and single
quotes. ENT_NOQUOTES Will leave both double and single quotes unconverted.

Support for the optional {quote} parameter was added in PHP 4.0.3.

Like |htmlspecialchars|, it takes an optional third argument {charset} which
defines character set used in conversion. Support for this argument was added
in PHP 4.1.0. Presently, the ISO-8859-1 character set is used as the default.

If you're wanting to decode instead (the reverse) you can use
|html_entity_decode|.

A |htmlentities| example

<?php >
  $str = "A 'quote' is <b>bold</b>";
  
  // Outputs: A 'quote' is <b>bold</b>
  echo htmlentities($str);
  
  // Outputs: A &amp;#039;quote&amp;#039; is <b>bold</b>
  echo htmlentities($str, ENT_QUOTES);
?>

|htmlspecialchars|, |nl2br|, and |urlencode|.
