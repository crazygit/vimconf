id3_remove_tag -- Remove an existing ID3 tag

  bool id3_remove_tag(string filename [, int version])~

|id3_remove_tag| is used to remove the information stored of an ID3 tag. If no
tag has been present, it will return FALSE and leave the file as it was.

Instead of a filename you may also pass a valid stream resource.

The optional {version} parameter allows you to specify the version of the tag
as MP3 files may contain both, version 1.x and version 2.x tags.

|id3_remove_tag| example

<?php >
  $result = id3_remove_tag( "path/to/example.mp3", ID3_V1_0 );
  if ($result === true) {
      echo "Tag succesfully removed\n";
  }
?>

If the file is writable and contained a 1.0 tag, this will output:

  Tag succesfully removed

Currently |id3_remove_tag| only supports version 1.0 and 1.1. If you choose to
remove a 1.0 tag and the file contains a 1.1 tag, this tag will be removed, as
v1.1 is only an extension of 1.0.

See also |id3_get_tag|, |id3_set_tag| and |id3_get_version|.
