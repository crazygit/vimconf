snmpwalk -- Fetch all the SNMP objects from an agent

  array snmpwalk(string hostname, string community, string object_id [, int timeout [, int retries]])~

Returns an array of SNMP object values starting from the {object_id} as root
and FALSE on error.

|snmpwalk| function is used to read all the values from an SNMP agent
specified by the {hostname}. {Community} specifies the read community for
that agent. A NULL {object_id} is taken as the root of the SNMP objects tree
and all objects under that tree are returned as an array. If {object_id} is
specified, all the SNMP objects below that {object_id} are returned.

<?php >
  $a = snmpwalk("127.0.0.1", "public", ""); 
?>

Above function call would return all the SNMP objects from the SNMP agent
running on localhost. One can step through the values with a loop

<?php >
  foreach ($a as $val) {
      echo "$val\n";
  }
?>
