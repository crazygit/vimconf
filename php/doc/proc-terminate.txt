proc_terminate -- kills a process opened by proc_open

  int proc_terminate(resource process [, int signal])~

Signals a {process} (created using |proc_open|) that it should terminate.
|proc_terminate| returns immediately and does not wait for the process to
terminate.

The optional {signal} is only useful on POSIX operating systems; you may
specify a signal to send to the process using the kill(2) system call. The
default is SIGTERM.

|proc_terminate| allows you terminate the process and continue with other
tasks. You may poll the process (to see if it has stopped yet) by using the
|proc_get_status| function.

|proc_open| |proc_close| |proc_get_status|
