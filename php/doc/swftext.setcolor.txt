This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swftext->setspacing| changes the current text color. Default is black. I
think. Color is represented using the RGB system.
