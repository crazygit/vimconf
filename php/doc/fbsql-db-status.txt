fbsql_db_status -- Get the status for a given database

  int fbsql_db_status(string database_name [, resource link_identifier])~

Returns: An integer value with the current status.

|fbsql_db_status| requests the current status of the database specified by
{database_name}. If the {link_identifier} is omitted the default
link_identifier will be used.

The return value can be one of the following constants: FALSE - The exec
handler for the host was invalid. This error will occur when the
link_identifier connects directly to a database by using a port number.
FBExec can be available on the server but no connection has been made for it.

FBSQL_UNKNOWN - The Status is unknown.

FBSQL_STOPPED - The database is not running. Use |fbsql_start_db| to start the
database.

FBSQL_STARTING - The database is starting.

FBSQL_RUNNING - The database is running and can be used to perform SQL
operations.

FBSQL_STOPPING - The database is stopping.

FBSQL_NOEXEC - FBExec is not running on the server and it is not possible to
get the status of the database.
