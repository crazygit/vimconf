readline_completion_function -- Registers a completion function

  bool readline_completion_function(callback function)~

This function registers a completion function. You must supply the name of an
existing function which accepts a partial command line and returns an array
of possible matches. This is the same kind of functionality you'd get if you
hit your tab key while using Bash.
