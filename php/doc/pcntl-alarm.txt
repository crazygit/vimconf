pcntl_alarm -- Set an alarm clock for delivery of a signal

  int pcntl_alarm(int seconds)~

The |pcntl_alarm| function creates a timer that will send a SIGALRM signal to
the process after {seconds} seconds. If {seconds} is zero, no new alarm is
created. Any call to |pcntl_alarm| will cancel any previously set alarm.

|pcntl_alarm| will return the time in seconds that any previously scheduled
alarm had remaining before it was to be delivered, or 0 if there was no
previously scheduled alarm.
