mb_ereg_replace -- Replace regular expression with multibyte support

  string mb_ereg_replace(string pattern, string replacement, string string [, string option])~

|mb_ereg_replace| scans {string} for matches to {pattern}, then replaces the
matched text with {replacement} and returns the result string or FALSE on
error. Multibyte character can be used in {pattern}.

Matching condition can be set by {option} parameter. If i is specified for
this parameter, the case will be ignored. If x is specified, white space will
be ignored. If m is specified, match will be executed in multiline mode and
line break will be included in '.'. If p is specified, match will be executed
in POSIX mode, line break will be considered as normal character. If e is
specified, {replacement} string will be evaluated as PHP expression.

The internal encoding or the character encoding specified in
|mb_regex_encoding| will be used as character encoding.
