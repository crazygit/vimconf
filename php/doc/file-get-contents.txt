file_get_contents -- Reads entire file into a string

  string file_get_contents(string filename [, bool use_include_path [, resource context [, int offset [, int maxlen]]]])~

Identical to |file|, except that |file_get_contents| returns the file in a
string, starting at the specified {offset} up to {maxlen} bytes. On failure,
|file_get_contents| will return FALSE.

|file_get_contents| is the preferred way to read the contents of a file into a
string. It will use memory mapping techniques if supported by your OS to
enhance performance.

If you're opening a URI with special characters, such as spaces, you need to
encode the URI with |urlencode|.

{context} parameter can be skipped by NULL.

Version Description 5.0.0 Added the context support. 5.1.0 Added the {offset}
and {maxlen} parameters.

This function is binary-safe.

You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename and
for a list of supported URL protocols.

Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of contexts, refer
to .

When using SSL, Microsoft IIS will violate the protocol by closing the
connection without sending a close_notify indicator. PHP will report this as
"SSL: Fatal Protocol Error" when you reach the end of the data. To workaround
this, you should lower your error_reporting level not to include warnings. PHP
4.3.7 and higher can detect buggy IIS server software when you open the stream
using the https:// wrapper and will suppress the warning for you. If you are
using |fsockopen| to create an ssl:// socket, you are responsible for
detecting and suppressing the warning yourself.
