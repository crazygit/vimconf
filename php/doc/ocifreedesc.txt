ocifreedesc -- Deletes a large object descriptor

  bool ocifreedesc()~

|ocifreedesc| deletes a large object descriptor. Returns TRUE on success or
FALSE on failure.

This function was renamed to |oci_free_descriptor| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For
downward compatibility |ocifreedesc| can also be used. This is deprecated,
however.
