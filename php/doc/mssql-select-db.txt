mssql_select_db -- Select MS SQL database

  bool mssql_select_db(string database_name [, resource link_identifier])~

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|mssql_select_db| sets the current active database on the server that's
associated with the specified link identifier. If no link identifier is
specified, the last opened link is assumed. If no link is open, the function
will try to establish a link as if |mssql_connect| was called, and use it.

Every subsequent call to |mssql_query| will be made on the active database.

To escape the name of a database that contains spaces, hyphens ("-"), or any
other exceptional characters, the database name must be enclosed in brackets,
as is shown in the example, below. This technique must also be applied when
selecting a database name that is also a reserved word (such as "primary").

|mssql_select_db| example

<?php >
      $conn = mssql_connect('MYSQLSERVER', 'sa', 'password');
      mssql_select_db('[my data-base]', $conn);
?>
