imagecreatefromgd -- Create a new image from GD file or URL

  resource imagecreatefromgd(string filename)~

This function is currently not documented; only the argument list is
available.

You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename and
for a list of supported URL protocols.

Windows versions of PHP prior to PHP 4.3.0 do not support accessing remote
files via this function, even if allow_url_fopen is enabled.
