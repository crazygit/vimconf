ircg_set_on_die -- Set action to be executed when connection dies

  bool ircg_set_on_die(resource connection, string host, int port, string data)~

In case of the termination of connection {connection} IRCG will connect to
{host} at {port} (Note: host must be an IPv4 address, IRCG does not resolve
host-names due to blocking issues), send {data} to the new host connection
and will wait until the remote part closes connection. This can be used to
trigger a PHP script for example.

This feature requires IRCG 3.
