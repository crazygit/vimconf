move_uploaded_file -- Moves an uploaded file to a new location

  bool move_uploaded_file(string filename, string destination)~

This function checks to ensure that the file designated by {filename} is a
valid upload file (meaning that it was uploaded via PHP's HTTP POST upload
mechanism). If the file is valid, it will be moved to the filename given by
{destination}.

If {filename} is not a valid upload file, then no action will occur, and
|move_uploaded_file| will return FALSE.

If {filename} is a valid upload file, but cannot be moved for some reason, no
action will occur, and |move_uploaded_file| will return FALSE. Additionally,
a warning will be issued.

This sort of check is especially important if there is any chance that
anything done with uploaded files could reveal their contents to the user, or
even to other users on the same system.

|move_uploaded_file| is both safe mode and open_basedir aware. However,
restrictions are placed only on the {destination} path as to allow the moving
of uploaded files in which {filename} may conflict with such restrictions.
|move_uploaded_file| ensures the safety of this operation by allowing only
those files uploaded through PHP to be moved.

If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten.

See also |is_uploaded_file|, and the section Handling file uploads for a
simple usage example.
