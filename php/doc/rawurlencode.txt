rawurlencode -- URL-encode according to RFC 1738

  string rawurlencode(string str)~

Returns a string in which all non-alphanumeric characters except -_. have been
replaced with a percent (%) sign followed by two hex digits. This is the
encoding described in RFC 1738 for protecting literal characters from being
interpreted as special URL delimiters, and for protecting URL's from being
mangled by transmission media with character conversions (like some email
systems). For example, if you want to include a password in an FTP URL:

|rawurlencode| example 1

<?php >
  echo '<a href="ftp://user:', rawurlencode('foo @+%/'),
       '@ftp.example.com/x.txt">';
?>

Or, if you pass information in a PATH_INFO component of the URL:

|rawurlencode| example 2

<?php >
  echo '<a href="http://example.com/department_list_script/',
      rawurlencode('sales and marketing/Miami'), '">';
?>

See also |rawurldecode|, |urldecode|, |urlencode| and RFC 1738.
