version_compare -- Compares two "PHP-standardized" version number strings

  mixed version_compare(string version1, string version2 [, string operator])~

|version_compare| compares two "PHP-standardized" version number strings. This
is useful if you would like to write programs working only on some versions of
PHP.

|version_compare| returns -1 if the first version is lower than the second, 0
if they are equal, and +1 if the second is lower.
