fbsql_pconnect -- Open a persistent connection to a FrontBase Server

  resource fbsql_pconnect([string hostname [, string username [, string password]]])~

Returns: A positive FrontBase persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE
on error.

|fbsql_pconnect| establishes a connection to a FrontBase server. The following
defaults are assumed for missing optional parameters: {host} = 'localhost',
{username} = "_SYSTEM" and {password} = empty password.

To set Frontbase server port number, use |fbsql_select_db|.

|fbsql_pconnect| acts very much like |fbsql_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use.

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.
