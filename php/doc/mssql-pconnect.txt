mssql_pconnect -- Open persistent MS SQL connection

  resource mssql_pconnect([string servername [, string username [, string password]]])~

Returns: A positive MS SQL persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on
error.

|mssql_pconnect| acts very much like |mssql_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(|mssql_close| will not close links established by |mssql_pconnect|).

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.
