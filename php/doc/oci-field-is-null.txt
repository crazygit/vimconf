oci_field_is_null -- Checks if the field is NULL

  bool oci_field_is_null(resource stmt, mixed field)~

|oci_field_is_null| returns TRUE if field {field} from the {statement} is
NULL. Parameter {field} could be a field's index or a field's name
(uppercased).

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocicolumnisnull| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_field_is_null| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
