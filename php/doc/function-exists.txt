function_exists -- Return TRUE if the given function has been defined

  bool function_exists(string function_name)~

Checks the list of defined functions, both built-in (internal) and
user-defined, for {function_name}. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on
failure.

<?php >
  if (function_exists('imap_open')) {
      echo "IMAP functions are available.<br />\n";
  } else {
      echo "IMAP functions are not available.<br />\n";
  }
?>

Note that a function name may exist even if the function itself is unusable
due to configuration or compiling options (with the image functions being an
example). Also note that |function_exists| will return FALSE for constructs,
such as |include_once| and |echo|.

See also |method_exists| and |get_defined_functions|.
