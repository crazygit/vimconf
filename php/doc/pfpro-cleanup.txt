pfpro_cleanup -- Shuts down the Payflow Pro library

  bool pfpro_cleanup()~

|pfpro_cleanup| is used to shutdown the Payflow Pro library cleanly. It should
be called after you have processed any transactions and before the end of your
script. However you may omit this call, in which case this extension will
automatically call |pfpro_cleanup| after your script terminates.

See also |pfpro_init|.
