fbsql_close -- Close FrontBase connection

  bool fbsql_close([resource link_identifier])~

Returns: TRUE on success, FALSE on error.

|fbsql_close| closes the connection to the FrontBase server that's associated
with the specified link identifier. If {link_identifier} isn't specified, the
last opened link is used.

Using |fbsql_close| isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution.

|fbsql_close| example

<?php >
      $link = fbsql_connect("localhost", "_SYSTEM", "secret")
          or die("Could not connect");
      echo "Connected successfully";
      fbsql_close($link);
?>
