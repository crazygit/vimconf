fdf_open -- Open a FDF document

  resource fdf_open(string filename)~

The |fdf_open| function opens a file with form data. This file must contain
the data as returned from a PDF form or created using |fdf_create| and
|fdf_save|.

You can process the results of a PDF form POST request by writing the data
received in $HTTP_FDF_DATA to a file and open it using |fdf_open|. Starting
with PHP 4.3 you can also use |fdf_open_string| which handles temporary file
creation and cleanup for you.

Accessing the form data

<?php >
  // Save the FDF data into a temp file
  $fdffp = fopen("test.fdf", "w");
  fwrite($fdffp, $HTTP_FDF_DATA, strlen($HTTP_FDF_DATA));
  fclose($fdffp);
  
  // Open temp file and evaluate data
  $fdf = fdf_open("test.fdf");
  /* ... */
  fdf_close($fdf);
?>
