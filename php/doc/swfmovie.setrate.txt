SWFMovie->setrate -- Sets the animation's frame rate

  void swfmovie->setrate(int rate)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfmovie->setrate| sets the frame rate to {rate}, in frame per seconds.
Animation will slow down if the player can't render frames fast enough-
unless there's a streaming sound, in which case display frames are sacrificed
to keep sound from skipping.
