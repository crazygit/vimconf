lob->import -- Imports file data to the LOB

  bool lob->import(string filename)~

Writes data from {filename} in to the current position of large object.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocisavelobfile| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_lob_import| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
