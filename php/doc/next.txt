next -- Advance the internal array pointer of an array

  mixed next(array array)~

Returns the array value in the next place that's pointed to by the internal
array pointer, or FALSE if there are no more elements.

|next| behaves like |current|, with one difference. It advances the internal
array pointer one place forward before returning the element value. That
means it returns the next array value and advances the internal array pointer
by one. If advancing the internal array pointer results in going beyond the
end of the element list, |next| returns FALSE. If the array contains empty
elements, or elements that have a key value of 0 then this function will
return FALSE for these elements as well. To properly traverse an array which
may contain empty elements or elements with key values of 0 see the |each|
function.

Example use of |next| and friends

<?php >
  $transport = array('foot', 'bike', 'car', 'plane');
  $mode = current($transport); // $mode = 'foot';
  $mode = next($transport);    // $mode = 'bike';
  $mode = next($transport);    // $mode = 'car';
  $mode = prev($transport);    // $mode = 'bike';
  $mode = end($transport);     // $mode = 'plane';
?>
