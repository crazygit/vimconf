sybase_select_db -- Selects a Sybase database

  bool sybase_select_db(string database_name [, resource link_identifier])~

|sybase_select_db| sets the current active database on the server that's
associated with the specified link identifier. If no link identifier is
specified, the last opened link is assumed. If no link is open, the function
will try to establish a link as if |sybase_connect| was called, and use it.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Every subsequent call to |sybase_query| will be made on the active database.
