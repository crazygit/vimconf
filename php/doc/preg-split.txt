preg_split -- Split string by a regular expression

  array preg_split(string pattern, string subject [, int limit [, int flags]])~

Returns an array containing substrings of {subject} split along boundaries
matched by {pattern}.

If {limit} is specified, then only substrings up to {limit} are returned, and
if {limit} is -1, it actually means "no limit", which is useful for
specifying the {flags}.

{flags} can be any combination of the following flags (combined with bitwise |
operator): PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY If this flag is set, only non-empty pieces will
be returned by |preg_split|.

PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE If this flag is set, parenthesized expression in the
delimiter pattern will be captured and returned as well. This flag was added
for 4.0.5.

PREG_SPLIT_OFFSET_CAPTURE If this flag is set, for every occurring match the
appendant string offset will also be returned. Note that this changes the
return value in an array where every element is an array consisting of the
matched string at offset 0 and its string offset into {subject} at offset 1.
This flag is available since PHP 4.3.0 .

|preg_split| example : Get the parts of a search string

<?php >
  // split the phrase by any number of commas or space characters,
  // which include " ", \r, \t, \n and \f
  $keywords = preg_split("/[\s,]+/", "hypertext language, programming");
?>

Splitting a string into component characters

<?php >
  $str = 'string';
  $chars = preg_split('//', $str, -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);
  print_r($chars);
?>

Splitting a string into matches and their offsets

<?php >
  $str = 'hypertext language programming';
  $chars = preg_split('/ /', $str, -1, PREG_SPLIT_OFFSET_CAPTURE);
  print_r($chars);
?>

will yield:

  Array
  (
      [0] => Array
          (
              [0] => hypertext
              [1] => 0
          )
  
      [1] => Array
          (
              [0] => language
              [1] => 10
          )
  
      [2] => Array
          (
              [0] => programming
              [1] => 19
          )
  
  )

Parameter {flags} was added in PHP 4 Beta 3.
