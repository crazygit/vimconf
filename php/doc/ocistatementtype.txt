<?php >
      $conn = OCILogon("scott", "tiger");
      $sql  = "delete from emp where deptno = 10";
     
      $stmt = OCIParse($conn, $sql);
      if (OCIStatementType($stmt) == "DELETE") {
          die("You are not allowed to delete from this table<br />");
      }
     
      OCILogoff($conn);
?>

This function was renamed to |oci_statement_type| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For
downward compatibility |ocistatementtype| can also be used. This is
deprecated, however.
