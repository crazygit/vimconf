ociinternaldebug -- Enables or disables internal debug output

  void ociinternaldebug(int onoff)~

|ociinternaldebug| enables internal debug output. Set {onoff} to 0 to turn
debug output off, 1 to turn it on.

This function was renamed to |oci_internal_debug| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For
downward compatibility |ociinternaldebug| can also be used. This is
deprecated, however.
