stream_get_meta_data -- Retrieves header/meta data from streams/file pointers

  array stream_get_meta_data(resource stream)~

Returns information about an existing {stream}. The stream can be any stream
created by |fopen|, |fsockopen| and |pfsockopen|. The result array contains
the following items:

{timed_out} (bool) - TRUE if the stream timed out while waiting for data on
the last call to |fread| or |fgets|.

{blocked} (bool) - TRUE if the stream is in blocking IO mode. See
|stream_set_blocking|.

{eof} (bool) - TRUE if the stream has reached end-of-file. Note that for
socket streams this member can be TRUE even when {unread_bytes} is non-zero.
To determine if there is more data to be read, use |feof| instead of reading
this item.

{unread_bytes} (int) - the number of bytes currently contained in the PHP's
own internal buffer.

You shouldn't use this value in a script.

The following items were added in PHP 4.3:

{stream_type} (string) - a label describing the underlying implementation of
the stream.

{wrapper_type} (string) - a label describing the protocol wrapper
implementation layered over the stream. See for more information about
wrappers.

{wrapper_data} (mixed) - wrapper specific data attached to this stream. See
for more information about wrappers and their wrapper data.

{filters} (array) - and array containing the names of any filters that have
been stacked onto this stream. Documentation on filters can be found in the
Filters appendix.

This function was introduced in PHP 4.3, but prior to this version,
|socket_get_status| could be used to retrieve the first four items, for
socket based streams only.

In PHP 4.3 and later, |socket_get_status| is an alias for this function.

This function does NOT work on sockets created by the Socket extension.

The following items were added in PHP 5.0:

{mode} (string) - the type of access required for this stream (see Table 1 of
the fopen() reference)

{seekable} (bool) - whether the current stream can be seeked.

{uri} (string) - the URI/filename associated with this stream.
