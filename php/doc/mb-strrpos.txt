mb_strrpos -- Find position of last occurrence of a string in a string

  int mb_strrpos(string haystack, string needle [, string encoding])~

|mb_strrpos| returns the numeric position of the last occurrence of {needle}
in the {haystack} string. If {needle} is not found, it returns FALSE.

|mb_strrpos| performs multi-byte safe |strrpos| operation based on number of
characters. {needle} position is counted from the beginning of {haystack}.
First character's position is 0. Second character position is 1.

If {encoding} is omitted, internal encoding is assumed. |mb_strrpos| accepts
string for {needle} where |strrpos| accepts only character.

{encoding} is character encoding. If it is not specified, internal character
encoding is used.
