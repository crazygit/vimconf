oci_field_precision -- Tell the precision of a field

  int oci_field_precision(resource statement, int field)~

Returns precision of the field with {field} index (1-based).

For FLOAT columns, precision is nonzero and scale is -127. If precision is 0,
then column is NUMBER. Else it's NUMBER(precision, scale).

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocicolumnprecision| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_field_precision| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

See also |oci_field_scale| and |oci_field_type|.
