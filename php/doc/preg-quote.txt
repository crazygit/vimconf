preg_quote -- Quote regular expression characters

  string preg_quote(string str [, string delimiter])~

|preg_quote| takes {str} and puts a backslash in front of every character that
is part of the regular expression syntax. This is useful if you have a
run-time string that you need to match in some text and the string may
contain special regex characters.

If the optional {delimiter} is specified, it will also be escaped. This is
useful for escaping the delimiter that is required by the PCRE functions. The
/ is the most commonly used delimiter.
