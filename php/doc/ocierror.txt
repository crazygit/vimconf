ocierror -- Return the last error of stmt|conn|global

  array ocierror([resource stmt_or_conn_or_global])~

|ocierror| returns the last error found. If the optional
{stmt_or_conn_or_global} is not provided, the last error encountered is
returned. If no error is found, |ocierror| returns FALSE. |ocierror| returns
the error as an associative array. In this array, code consists the oracle
error code and message the oracle errorstring.

offset and sqltext will also be included in the return array to indicate the
location of the error and the original SQL text which caused it.

This function was renamed to |oci_error| after PHP >= 5.0.0. For downward
compatibility |ocierror| can also be used. This is deprecated, however.
