hw_pConnect -- Make a persistent database connection

  int hw_pconnect(string host, int port [, string username, string password])~

Returns a connection index on success, or FALSE if the connection could not be
made. Opens a persistent connection to a Hyperwave server. Each of the
arguments should be a quoted string, except for the port number. The
{username} and {password} arguments are optional and can be left out. In such
a case no identification with the server will be done. It is similar to
identify as user anonymous. This function returns a connection index that is
needed by other Hyperwave functions. You can have multiple persistent
connections open at once.
