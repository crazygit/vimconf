get_declared_classes -- Returns an array with the name of the defined classes

  array get_declared_classes()~

This function returns an array of the names of the declared classes in the
current script.

In PHP 4.0.1pl2, three extra classes are returned at the beginning of the
array: stdClass (defined in Zend/zend.c), OverloadedTestClass (defined in
ext/standard/basic_functions.c) and Directory (defined in
ext/standard/dir.c).

Also note that depending on what libraries you have compiled into PHP,
additional classes could be present. This means that you will not be able to
define your own classes using these names. There is a list of predefined
classes in the Predefined Classes section of the appendices.

<?php >
  print_r(get_declared_classes());

  Array
  (
      [0] => stdClass
      [1] => __PHP_Incomplete_Class
      [2] => Directory
  )
