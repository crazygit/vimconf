session_start -- Initialize session data

  bool session_start()~

|session_start| creates a session or resumes the current one based on the
current session id that's being passed via a request, such as GET, POST, or a
cookie.

This function always returns TRUE.

If you are using cookie-based sessions, you must call |session_start| before
anything is outputted to the browser.

A session example: page1.php

<?php >
  // page1.php
  
  session_start();
  
  echo 'Welcome to page #1';
  
  $_SESSION['favcolor'] = 'green';
  $_SESSION['animal']   = 'cat';
  $_SESSION['time']     = time();
  
  // Works if session cookie was accepted
  echo '<br /><a href="page2.php">page 2</a>';
  
  // Or maybe pass along the session id, if needed
  echo '<br /><a href="page2.php?' . SID . '">page 2</a>';
?>

After viewing page1.php, the second page page2.php will magically contain the
session data. Read the session reference for information on propagating
session ids as it, for example, explains what the constant SID is all about.

A session example: page2.php

<?php >
  // page2.php
  
  session_start();
  
  echo 'Welcome to page #2<br />';
  
  echo $_SESSION['favcolor']; // green
  echo $_SESSION['animal'];   // cat
  echo date('Y m d H:i:s', $_SESSION['time']);
  
  // You may want to use SID here, like we did in page1.php
  echo '<br /><a href="page1.php">page 1</a>';
?>

If you want to use a named session, you must call |session_name| before
calling |session_start|.

|session_start| will register internal output handler for URL rewriting when
trans-sid is enabled. If a user uses ob_gzhandler or like with |ob_start|,
the order of output handler is important for proper output. For example, user
must register ob_gzhandler before session start.

Use of zlib.output_compression is recommended rather than |ob_gzhandler|

As of PHP 4.3.3, calling |session_start| while the session has already been
started will result in an error of level E_NOTICE. Also, the second session
start will simply be ignored.

See also $_SESSION, session.auto_start, and |session_id|.
